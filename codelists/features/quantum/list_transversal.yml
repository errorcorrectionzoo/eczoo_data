  Quantum codes with transversal gates


intro: |
  Here is a list of all quantum codes that admit transversal gates. Applicable to codes living in a tensor-product space,
  such gates can be written as a tensor product of unitary operations, with each operation acting on its corresponding subsystem.

      # descendant_of: oaecc

    # Each list element of the 'codes:' list specifies a set of codes.  The set of
    # codes consists of the codes that satisfy all the given conditions
    # (e.g. property_set: rate AND descendant_of: quantum_code).
    #
    # The final codes selected for the code list is the union of all the sets
    # associated with each list element of 'codes:'.

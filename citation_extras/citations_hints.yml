# This file collects some "hints" for creating appropriate citations for certain
# citation keys.
#
# Normally, citations would automatically be generated via their arXiv
# identifier, or if applicable, directly their DOI.  But in some cases this
# automatic procedure needs some fine-tuning.  For instance, the arXiv entry
# might not list the corresponding DOI, or might point to the wrong (e.g. book
# instead of book chapter).  Such exceptional cases can be handled with "hints"
# collected here.

  # These entries are "presets" for standard references that might not be on the
  # arXiv or might not have a DOI.

  # Cite these works using, e.g.,  \cite{preset:PreskillNotes}

arxiv_to_doi_override:
  #
  # Manually specify DOIs for specific arXiv identifiers.
  #
  # This manual override should only be used in exceptional cases where the
  # arXiv entry does not list the DOI or if the listed DOI is incomplete or
  # incorrect.  E.g. https://github.com/errorcorrectionzoo/eczoo_data/issues/43
  #
  # Note: quote keys so that they don't get parsed as floats (!)

  '1604.04062': '10.26421/QIC16.15-16-1'


  # In this case, the DOI listed on Quantum's own webpage
  # (https://quantum-journal.org/papers/q-2021-12-20-605/) does not work!  So
  # let's pretend that there is no associated DOI so that, at least, we get an
  # arXiv citation.

features:

  # The fields below relate to specific properties of the code that are worth
  # noting. In some cases (see below), there might be multiple pieces of
  # information associated with a key (e.g., mutliple encoders/decoders,
  # multiple facts about fault tolerance, etc.); in such cases, the key
  # accepts a list of text entries, with one item per piece of information.
  #
  # Any keys below should be omitted if they do not apply.

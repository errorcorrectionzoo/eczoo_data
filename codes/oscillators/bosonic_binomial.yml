description: 'Binomial codes are bosonic rotation codes designed to exactly protect against errors consisting of powers of raising and lowering operators up to some maximum power \cite{doi:10.1103/PhysRevX.6.031006}. Binomial codes are spin-coherent states embedded into an oscillator \cite{doi:10.1103/PhysRevA.97.032346}.'

protection: 'An \((N, S)\) binomial code protects against \(L\) boson losses, \(G\) boson gains, and dephasing up to \(\hat{n}^{\D}\), where \(S=L+G\) and \(N = \mathrm{max}(L,G,2D)\). Binomial codes approximately protects against continuous-time amplitude damping, boson loss and gain, and dephasing.'

  # The fields below relate to specific properties of the code that are worth
  # noting. In some cases (see below), there might be multiple pieces of
  # information associated with a field (e.g., mutliple encoders/decoders,
  # multiple facts about fault tolerance, etc.); in such cases, the field
  # accepts a list of text entries, with one item per piece of information.

  # Any fields below should be omitted if they do not apply.

notes:
  - 'The mean occupation number, or average number of bosons in the mode, is \((N+1)(S+1)(d-1)/2 \), where \(d\) is the qudit dimension.'

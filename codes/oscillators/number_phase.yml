description: 'Number phase codes are unnormalized bosonic rotation codes that can be approximately implemented physically via a normalization procedure. The logical states of an order \(N\) number phase code are \(\vert 0_L \rangle = \sum_{m=0}^{2N-1} \vert m\pi/N \rangle\) and \(\vert 0_L \rangle = \sum_{m=0}^{2N-1} (-1)^m \vert m\pi/N \rangle\), where \(\vert m\pi/N \rangle = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i} n \phi} \vert n \rangle\). '

protection: 'Number phase codes of order \(N\) detect up to \(N\) photon loss or gain errors, and dephasing up to \(\theta = \pi/N\).'

  # The fields below relate to specific properties of the code that are worth
  # noting. In some cases (see below), there might be multiple pieces of
  # information associated with a field (e.g., mutliple encoders/decoders,
  # multiple facts about fault tolerance, etc.); in such cases, the field
  # accepts a list of text entries, with one item per piece of information.

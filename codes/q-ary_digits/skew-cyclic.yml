features:

  # The fields below relate to specific properties of the code that are worth
  # noting. In some cases (see below), there might be multiple pieces of
  # information associated with a field (e.g., mutliple encoders/decoders,
  # multiple facts about fault tolerance, etc.); in such cases, the field
  # accepts a list of text entries, with one item per piece of information.
  #
  # Any fields below should be omitted if they do not apply.

realizations:
  # List and explain the different "domains" of realizations in list items.

  # said in a paragraph.

  - 'Computer algebra software is used to find most codes of this type. \cite{arXiv:math/0604603} give several examples of codes, which have slightly improved minimum distance for some \((n,k)\) codes.'

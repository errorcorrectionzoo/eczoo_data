description: |
  Code that encodes quantum and classical information and requires pre-shared entanglement for transmission.

  EA hybrid block quantum codes on \(n\) Galois qubits of dimensional \(q\) are denoted by \(((n,k:c,d;e))_q\), where \(k\) (\(c\)) is the number of encoded qubits (classical bits), where \(d\) is the distance, and where \(e\) is the required number of pre-shared ebits.
  Similarly, block codes on \(n\) modular qudits are denoted by \(((n,k:c,d;e))_{\mathbb{Z}_q}\).

  In alternative conventions (not used here), EA hybrid codes are called entanglement-assisted classical-quantum (EACQ) codes.
  Here, we use the term classical-quantum for codes for transmitting classical information over quantum channels.

  The EA hybrid Singleton bound represents a triple trade-off region in the combined classical-bit, qubit, and e-bit space \cite{arxiv:2202.02184}.

      detail: 'EA hybrid codes utilize additional ancillary subsystems in a pre-shared entangled state, but reduce to hybrid QECCs when said subsystems are interpreted as noiseless physical subsystems.'

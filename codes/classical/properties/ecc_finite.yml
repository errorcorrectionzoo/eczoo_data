code_id: ecc_finite

name: 'Finite-dimensional error-correcting code (ECC)'
short_name: 'Finite ECC'
introduced: '\cite{doi:10.1002/j.1538-7305.1948.tb01338.x}'

description: |
  An error-correcting code defined over a finite alphabet.

protection: |
  A code corrects errors associated with a noise channel if it is possible to recover any codeword after its coordinates have been changed after going through the channel. 
  
  More technically, an error-correcting code \((u,\mathcal{E})\) is an \textit{encoder} function \(u:[1\cdots K]\to[1\cdots N]\) with a set of correctable errors \(E:[1\cdots N]\to [1\cdots M]\) with the following property: there exists a \textit{decoder} function \(d:[1\cdots M]\to [1\cdots K]\) such that for all \(E\in\cal{E}\) and states \(x\in[1\cdots K]\), \(d(E(e(x)))=x\) \cite{preset:GottesmanBook}.

  Finite ECCs can also be defined by axiomatically defining their encoding functions \cite{doi:10.1016/S0019-9958(63)80010-8}.

#Consider a transmitted binary code-word $X_n \in C$ drawn from an arbitrary rate R code-book C, i.e. a set of $2^{nR} = 2^K$ strings in $\{0, 1\}^n$, where (n, K) is a core pair of parameters of a codebook. Assume independent post-hard-detection channel noise, $N^n$, which also takes values from ${0, 1}^n$, additively alters $X^n$ between transmission and reception. The resulting sequence is $Y^n = X^n \bigoplus N^n$, where $\bigoplus$ represents addition modulo 2.
#From $Y^n$ GRAND attempts to determine $X^n$ indirectly by identifying $N^n$ through sequentially taking putative noise sequences, $z^n$, which is sometimes refered to as patterns, subtracting them from the received signal and querying if what remains, $Y^n \bigoplus z^n$, is in the code-book C. If transmitted code-words are all equally likely and $z^n$ are queried in order from most likely to least likely based on the true channel statistics, the first instance where a code-book element is found is an optimally accurate maximum likelihood decoding in the hard detection setting.

notes:
  - 'The modern theory of error-correcting codes is rooted in the foundational work of C. Shannon \cite{doi:10.1002/j.1538-7305.1948.tb01338.x}, but error-correcting codes have been used prior to that work \cite{doi:10.1007/bf03025254}.'
  - 'Boolean networks, designed to model gene regulatory networks, generically develop error-correcting codes when they are evolved to perform computations \cite{arxiv:2303.14448}.'

#Classic (L,G)-Goppa codes are a subclass of alternant codes, and they are also cousins of AG codes. Alternant codes as such don't qualify as cousins of AG codes. They are in fact subfield subcodes of GRS codes and as such are cousins of BCH codes and children of GRS codes.
#A subfield subcode is a subset of the code formed of the vectors all of whose coordinates are in a subfield (or even just a subset, they have considered subset subcodes, where this subalphabet does not have to be a field, e.g., 49 -> 46).

description: |
  Also known as \textit{Gallager codes}. Family of \([n,k,d]\) linear codes for which the number of nonzero entries in each row and column of the parity check matrix are both bounded by a constant as \(n\to\infty\). In other words, the parity-check matrix of an LDPC code is sparse.

  A \textit{parity check} is performed by taking the inner product of a row of the parity-check matrix with a codeword that has been affected by a noise channel. A parity check yields either zero (no error) or one (error) for binary codes, while yielding zero (no error) or a nonzero field element (error) for \(q\)-ary codes. Despite the fact that there is more than one nonzero outcome, \(q\)-ary linear codes with sparse parity-check matrices are also called LDPC codes.

#features:
#  rate: 'b/c. The rate (b/c) for this code comes close to the maximum of what channel allows (Shannon limit) as code size increases.'
#  encoders:
#    - 'Encoding complexity is of O(n) per symbol (which is good).'

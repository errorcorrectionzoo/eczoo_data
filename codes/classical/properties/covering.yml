code_id: covering
name: 'Covering code'

description: |
  A code \(C\) in a metric space is covering if the union of balls of some radius centered at the codewords covers the entire space. For example, a \(q\)-ary code \(C\) is \(\rho\)-covering if \(\forall v \in GF(q)^{n}\), there is a codeword \(c \in C\) such that the Hamming distance \(D(c,v)\leq \rho\).

  The \textit{covering radius} \(\rho(C)\) is the smallest non-negative integer \(\rho\) such that \(C\) is \(\rho\)-covering, i.e.
  \begin{align}
    \rho(C)=\max_{{v\in GF(q)^{n}}}\min_{{c\in C}}d(v,c)~.
  \end{align}
  For a linear code \([n,k]_q\), the covering radius is the minimum number of columns of the code's parity check matrix which cover \(GF(q)^{n-k}\).

  The covering radius satisfies various inequalities. A code \(C\) with distance \(d\) satisfies the relation
  \begin{align}
    \rho(C)\geq \frac{|d-1|}{2}~. \label{perfect-ref}
  \end{align}
  Linear \([n,k]_q\) codes also satisfy the \textit{redundancy bound}
  \begin{align}
    \rho(C)\leq n-k
  \end{align}
  and the \textit{sphere covering bound}
  \begin{align}
    \rho(C)\leq \min{\left(p~\bigg\rvert \sum_{i=0}^{p} {n \choose i}(q-1)^{i}|C| \geq q^{n}\right)}~. \label{spherepacking-perfect-label}
  \end{align}
  A code is perfect iff it satisfies Eqs. \eqref{perfect-ref} and \eqref{spherepacking-perfect-label} with equality.

  In general, finding the covering radius of a given code is difficult. Complexity analysis as well as an extensive study on bounds can be found in Ref. \cite{manual:{G. Cohen, I. Honkala, S. Litsyn, A. Lobstein, \emph{Covering Codes}, Elsevier (1997).}}.

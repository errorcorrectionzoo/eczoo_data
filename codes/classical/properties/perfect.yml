description: |
  An \((n,K,2t+1)_q\) \(q\)-ary code is perfect if parameters \(n\), \(K\), \(t\), and \(q\) are such that the Hamming (a.k.a. sphere-packing) bound
  \begin{align}
  \sum_{j=0}^{t}(q-1)^{j}{n \choose j}\leq q^{n}/K
  \end{align}
  becomes an equality. For example, for a binary \(q=2\) code with one logical bit (\(K=2\)) and \(t=1\), the bound becomes \(n+1 \leq 2^{n-1}\). Any nontrivial perfect linear code is either a Hamming code or a binary or ternary Golay code.

  Perfect codes are those for which balls of Hamming radius \(t\) exactly fill the space of all \(n\) \(q\)-ary strings. \textit{Quasi-perfect codes} are those for which balls of Hamming radius \(t\) are disjoint, while balls of radius \(t+1\) cover the space with possible overlaps.

  For binary codes with \(K=2^k\), one can work out an asymptotic Hamming bound in the large-\(n,k,t\) limit,
  \begin{align}
  \frac{k}{n}\leq 1-H(t/n),
  \end{align}
  where \(H\) is the binary entropy function.

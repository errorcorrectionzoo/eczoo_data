code_id: block

name: 'Block code'

description: |
  A code intended to encode a piece, or block, of a data stream on a \textit{block} of \(n\) symbols.
  Each symbol is taken from some fixed possibly infinite alphabet \(\Sigma\) \cite[Ch. 3]{doi:10.1007/978-3-642-58575-3}, which can include bits, Galois fields, rings, or real numbers.

  The overall alphabet of the code is \(\Sigma^n\), and \(n\) is called the \textit{length} of the code.
  In some cases, only a subset of \(\Sigma^n\) is available to use for constructing the code.
  For example, in the case of spherical codes, one is constrained to \(n\)-dimensional real vectors on the unit sphere.

  An alternative more stringent definition (not used here) is in terms of a map encoding logical information from \(\Sigma^k\) into \(\Sigma^n\), yielding an \((n,k,d)_{\Sigma}\) block code, where \(d\) is the code distance.

# A common family of codes are the \textit{block codes}, intended to encode a piece, or block, of a data stream.
# A block code encodes strings of length \(k\), where each character in the string an element of some fixed alphabet \(\Sigma\), into strings of length \(n\). In other words, a block code encoding is a map from \(\Sigma^k\) to \(\Sigma^n\), where \(N = |\Sigma|^n\), \(K=|\Sigma|^k\), and \(|\Sigma|\) is the number of elements in the alphabet.

protection: |
  Block codes protect from errors acting on a few of the \(n\) symbols. A block code with \textit{distance} \(d\) detects errors acting on up to \(d-1\) symbols, and corrects erasure errors on up to \(d-1\) symbols.

features:
  rate: 'Ideal decoding error scales is suppressed exponentially with the number of subsystems \(n\), and the exponent has been studied in Ref. \cite{doi:10.1002/j.1538-7305.1959.tb03905.x,doi:10.1016/S0019-9958(67)90052-6,manual:{Fano, Robert M. The transmission of information. Vol. 65. Cambridge, MA, USA: Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Research Laboratory of Electronics, 1949.}}.'
  decoders:
    - 'Decoding an error-correcting code is equivalent to finding the ground state of some statistical mechanical model \cite{doi:10.1038/339693a0}.'

code_id: block

name: 'Block code'

description: |
  A code intended to encode a piece, or block, of a data stream on a \textit{block} of \(n\) symbols, with each symbol taking values from a fixed alphabet \(\Sigma\).

  The overall alphabet of the code is \(\Sigma^n\), and \(n\) is called the \textit{length} of the code \cite[Ch. 3]{doi:10.1007/978-3-642-58575-3}.
  In some cases, only a subset of \(\Sigma^n\) is available to use for constructing the code.
  For example, in the case of spherical codes, one is constrained to \(n\)-dimensional real vectors on the unit sphere.
  The table below lists the most common alphabets used in block codes, along with names of the corresponding codewords.
    \begin{table}
      \begin{cells}
      \celldata<c H, c H>{alphabet \(\Sigma\) & codewords}
      \celldata<c, c>{
      \(\mathbb{Z}_{2}=GF(2)\) & bitstrings
          \\
      \(GF(q)\) & \(q\)-ary strings
          \\
      \(\mathbb{Z}_{q}\) & \(q\)-ary strings over \(\mathbb{Z}_{q}\)
          \\
      \(\mathbb{R}\) & sphere packings
          \\
      \(G\) & group elements
      }
      \end{cells}
      \caption{Table listing the most common alphabets used in block codes. Here, \(GF(q)\) is a \hyperref[topic:finite-fields]{finite field} and \(G\) is a finite or infinite group.}
      \label{table:alphabets}
    \end{table}

  An alternative more stringent definition (not used here) is in terms of a map encoding logical information from \(\Sigma^k\) into \(\Sigma^n\), yielding an \((n,k,d)_{\Sigma}\) block code, where \(d\) is the code distance.

  \subsection{Finite-field alphabet}
  \begin{defterm}{Finite fields}
  \label{topic:finite-fields}
  The most common alphabets used in block codes Galois or finite fields \(GF(q)=\mathbb{F}_q\), which are sets of \(q\) elements closed under addition and multiplication.
  They are finite analogues of the real or complex numbers, and a unique field exists for every power \(q=p^m\) of a prime \(p\).
  The prime-field case reduces to \(\mathbb{Z}_p\), a group under addition that is promoted to a field by defining multiplication modulo \(p\); the case \(p=2\) yields the binary field \(\mathbb{Z}_2\).
  Every finite field comes with a 0 element (additive identity), a 1 element (multiplicative identity), and additive (multiplicative) inverses for all (nonzero) elements.  
  An element whose powers exhaust all nonzero field elements is called \textit{primitive}.
  Fields come with a trace operation, the \textit{field trace}, which maps elements \(\gamma \in GF(q)\) to elements of \(GF(p)\) as
  \begin{align}
    \text{tr}(\gamma)=\sum_{k=0}^{m-1}\gamma^{p^{k}}~.
  \end{align}
  The field trace can be thought of as an averaging over the field's Galois group, which is the cyclic group generated by \(\gamma\to\gamma^p\) \cite[pg. 113]{preset:MacSlo}.
  Fields also come with a \textit{field norm},
  \begin{align}
    N(\gamma)=\prod_{k=0}^{m-1}\gamma^{p^{k}}=\gamma^{(p^{m}-1)/(p-1)}~.
  \end{align}
  In the case of the complex numbers, analogues of the field trace and field norm are the real part and  norm squared of a complex number, respectively.

  Any field \(GF(q=p^m)\) can be thought of as an \(m\)-dimensional vector space over \(GF(p)\) a.k.a. the \(m\)th \textit{extension} of \(GF(p)\) (similar to the complex numbers being an extension of the reals).
  Conversely, \(GF(p)\) is an example of a \textit{subfield} of \(GF(q)\).
  Certain field elements are chosen to be the \textit{basis} of \(GF(q)\) over \(GF(p)\), and all other elements are expressed as linear combinations of these basis elements.
  More generally, elements of fields such as \(GF(p^{ml})\) can be written as \(m\)-dimensional vectors over \(GF(p^l)\) or \((m\times l)\)-dimensional matrices over \(GF(p)\). 
  This idea is used to convert between ordinary block codes and matrix-based codes such as disk array codes and rank-metric codes.
  The field norm and field trace can likewise be defined for fields \(GF(q^m)\) that are extensions of \(GF(q)\) for non-prime \(q\).
  \end{defterm}

  An example of a field is the quaternary Galois field \(GF(4) = \{0,1,\omega, \omega^2=\bar{\omega}\}\) with \(p=m=2\).
  In this case, \(\omega\) can be interpreted as a third root of unity, but more formally it is defined as a solution to the polynomial equation \(1+x+x^2=0\).
  Field elements can be represented as two-dimensional vectors with binary elements, \(GF(4)=GF(2^2)\), using the basis \(1\cong(1,0)\) and \(\omega\cong(0,1)\):
  \begin{align}
    0&\leftrightarrow(0,0)\cong0\cdot1+0\cdot\omega\\1&\leftrightarrow(0,1)\cong0\cdot1+1\cdot\omega\\\omega&\leftrightarrow(1,1)\cong1\cdot1+1\cdot\omega\\\bar{\omega}&\leftrightarrow(1,0)\cong1\cdot1+0\cdot\omega~.
  \end{align}
  In this way, the field elements form the Klein four group \(\mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_2\) under addition.
  One can check that the trace operation, \(\text{tr}(\gamma) = \gamma + \gamma^2\), outputs either 0 or 1 for any element \(\gamma\in GF(4)\).

# The field trace in this case is similar to taking the real part of a complex number, \(\text{tr}(\gamma) = \gamma + \gamma^2\) for any element \(\gamma\).

# The group of isometries of \(q\)-ary Hamming space is a combination of the monomial group, the Galois group of \(GF(q)\), and the group formed by the action of the space on itself (under addition) \cite{preset:HKSclass}.

# A common family of codes are the \textit{block codes}, intended to encode a piece, or block, of a data stream.
# A block code encodes strings of length \(k\), where each character in the string an element of some fixed alphabet \(\Sigma\), into strings of length \(n\). In other words, a block code encoding is a map from \(\Sigma^k\) to \(\Sigma^n\), where \(N = |\Sigma|^n\), \(K=|\Sigma|^k\), and \(|\Sigma|\) is the number of elements in the alphabet.

protection: |
  Block codes protect from errors acting on a few of the \(n\) symbols. A block code with \textit{distance} \(d\) detects errors acting on up to \(d-1\) symbols, and corrects erasure errors on up to \(d-1\) symbols.

features:
  rate: 'Ideal decoding error scales is suppressed exponentially with the number of subsystems \(n\), and the exponent has been studied in Ref. \cite{doi:10.1002/j.1538-7305.1959.tb03905.x,doi:10.1016/S0019-9958(67)90052-6,manual:{Fano, Robert M. The transmission of information. Vol. 65. Cambridge, MA, USA: Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Research Laboratory of Electronics, 1949.}}.'

    - 'Decoding an error-correcting code is equivalent to finding the ground state of some statistical mechanical model \cite{doi:10.1038/339693a0}.'

    \begin{defterm}{Asymptotic notation}
    \label{topic:asymptotics}
    We are often interested in how parameters of particular infinite block-code families scale with increasing block length \(n\), necessitating the use of asymptotic or Bachmannâ€“Landau notation; see the book \cite{manual:{Cormen, T. H., Leiserson, C. E., Rivest, R. L., & Stein, C. (2022). Introduction to algorithms. MIT press.}}. The table below summarizes the notation used throughout the EC Zoo for relating functions \(f,g\) that both grow with \(n\).
    \begin{table}
      \begin{cells}
      \celldata<c H, c H>{relation & behavior}

      \(f(n)=O(g(n))\) & \(\phantom{c_{2}\geq}{\displaystyle \underset{n\to\infty}{\lim}\frac{|f(n)|}{|g(n)|}}\leq c\)
          \\
      \(f(n)=\Omega(g(n))\) & \(0<{\displaystyle \underset{n\to\infty}{\lim}\frac{|f(n)|}{|g(n)|}}\phantom{\leq c_{2}}\)
          \\
      \(f(n)=\Theta(g(n))\) & \(c_{1}\leq{\displaystyle \underset{n\to\infty}{\lim}\frac{|f(n)|}{|g(n)|}}\leq c_{2}\)

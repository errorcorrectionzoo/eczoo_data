code_id: traceability

name: 'Traceability code'
introduced: '\cite{doi:10.1109/18.841169}'

description: |
  A code that protects copyrighted materials by providing the ability to trace potential leaks via combinatorial properties \cite{doi:10.1109/18.841169}.
  The code also aids in helping to ensure that an innocent party cannot be framed for the pirated information \cite{doi:10.1109/18.915661}.

  Codes with strong traceability trace at least one member of a group that has constructed a pirate decoder (i.e., a generic pirate decryption process \cite{doi:10.1109/18.841169}).
  A code with weak traceability has the ability to ensure that no group is able to frame another user \cite{doi:10.1109/18.915661}.

  rate: |
    Suppose \(n\) is the number of users, \(k\) is the number of users known by the pirates, and \(p\) is the probability that the pirates cannot be traced.
    An open (public) resilient scheme using a hash function has the personal keys of the users consisting of \(O(k^{2}\log n)\) decryption keys which is the amount of decryptions needed to reveal the information.
    The amount of data redundancy overhead is about \(O(k^{4}\log n)\) \cite{doi:10.1109/18.841169}.

    A secret resilient scheme using a hash function has the personal keys of the users consisting of \(O(k \log(n/p))\) decryption keys, which is the amount of decryptions needed to reveal the information.
    The amount of data redundancy overhead is about \(O(k^{2} \log(n/p))\) \cite{doi:10.1109/18.841169}.

    A threshold (secret) scheme using a hash function that is successful against pirates which decrypt with probability \(> q\), has the personal keys of the users consisting of \((4k/3q)\log(n/p)\) decryption keys (note that this is the same as in the secret resilient scheme above).
    These types of schemes only need order \(O(1)\) decryption operations performed by users to decrypt the information successfully.
    Finally, the amount of data redundancy overhead is 4k encrypted keys which is a large improvement compared to the above \cite{doi:10.1109/18.841169}.

  decoders:
    - 'A pirate decoder represents the pirate decryption process that is considered a black box.
    It is not necessary to know how it works so a pirate decode could be a physical box or even code on a computer \cite{doi:10.1109/18.841169}.'


realizations:
  - 'Code used in broadcast messages, pay-per-view movies, and protecting copyrighted online material \cite{doi:10.1109/18.915661}.'

notes:
  - 'Note that in the feature section above, the hash function maps the users into a set of 2k^{2} decryption keys \cite{doi:10.1109/18.841169}.'
  - 'For code tables, see Refs. \cite{doi:10.1109/18.841169} and \cite{doi:10.1109/18.915661}.'
  # - 'Fully resilient schemes guarantee to trace the source of any piracy \cite{doi:10.1109/18.841169}.'
  # - 'Threshold schemes have a parameter of the scheme, say q, for which the scheme only traces sources of pirate decoders that decrypt with greater probability than q \cite{doi:10.1109/18.841169}.'
  # - 'Secret schemes are those that have their decryption scheme and keys as secret. The open schemes are those that the decryption schemes and decryption keys are public information \cite{doi:10.1109/18.841169}.'

code_id: ipp
# not necessarily an ECC

name: 'Identifiable parent property (IPP) code'
short_name: 'IPP'
introduced: '\cite{doi:10.1006/jcta.1997.2851}'

description: |
  A code that is embedded in copyrighted content in order to detect unauthorized redistribution of said content by pirates.
  In particular, IPP codes can detect pirates even when segments of the content are mixed together.

  Each copy of the content (say, a movie or videogame) is embedded with a codeword of an IPP code.
  The location of this codeword is unknown to the buyer of the content, and reselling a copy will expose the seller as a pirate.

  A coalition of \(t\) pirates can then obtain the content and mix their copies together so as to obfuscate their identities.
  The \textit{descendant} bit-string corresponding to the pirated mixed copy therefore contains subsets of codeword coordinates of the copies that were used in the mixing.

  Mathematically, if \(C\) is an IPP code of length \(n\), and \(B=\{c_1 \cdots c_t\}\) is a set of \(t\) codewords, then \(a\) is called a \textit{descendant} of \(B\) if every coordinate of \(a\) also exists as a coordinate (in the same position) of at least one of the codewords in \(B\).
  In other words, for all coordinates \(i\), we require that \(a^i = c_j^{i}\) and some \(c_j \in A\), where \(c_j^i\) denotes the \(i\)th coordinate of the codeword \(c_j\).

  A \(t\)-IPP code has the ability that, given any descendent, a parent codeword can always be identified by examining all possible \(t\)-subsets of the code \cite{doi:10.1016/j.endm.2005.07.012}.

# Denote by \(X(C)\) the set of descendants of all \(t\)-tuples of the codewords.
# There is a mapping from the set \(X(C)\) such that for every \(z\) in \(X(C)\), its image under this mapping is one of the \(t\) parents of \(z\) in \(C\).

features:
  rate: 'A hypergraph approach can be used to show that, for any \(t \leq q\), there exists a sequence of IPP codes with asymptotically non-vanishing rate \cite{doi:10.1137/S0895480100376848}.'

      detail: 'A \(t\)-IPP code is a \(t\)-SFP code, which further implies it is a \(t\)-FP code; see \cite[Sec. I.C]{doi:10.1109/18.915661} and \cite{doi:10.1016/j.endm.2005.07.012}.'

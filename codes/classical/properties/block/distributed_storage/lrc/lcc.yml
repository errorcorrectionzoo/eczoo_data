code_id: lcc

name: 'Locally correctable code (LCC)'
short_name: 'LCC'
# introduced: '\cite{doi:10.1145/335305.335315}'

# LDCs are similar in nature to LRC, but work in another regime. Namely, given a heavily corrupted codeword within the decoding radius, you need to recover any given bit of the message using a small number of queries

#   Block code for which one can efficiently correct a given string.
# Efficiency of the correction is quantified by the code's \textit{query complexity} \(u\), and correction is performed by sampling subsets of \(u\) bits.
# Local decodability may only be possible up to some tolerated corruption rate \(\delta\).


description: |
  Recall that a block code encodes a length-\(k\) message into a length-\(n\) codeword, which is then sent through a noise channel to yield an error word.
  Informally, an LCC is a block code for which one can recover any coordinate of a codeword from at most \(r\) coordinates of the error word (assuming the error word is within some tolerated corruption rate \(\delta\)).

  Modified versions of local correctability include \textit{relaxed local correctability} \cite{doi:10.4086/toc.2020.v016a018}.

protection: |
  Three-query LCCs have to have length that is superpolynomial in the message length \cite{arxiv:2311.00558}.

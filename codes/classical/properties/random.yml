description: |
  Code whose construction is non-deterministic in some way, i.e., codes that utilize an elements of randomness somewhere in their construction. Members of this class range from fully non-deterministic codes, to codes whose multi-step construction is deterministic with the exception of a single step.

  Typically, random codes are selected with uniform distribution from some ensemble of codes. For example, a random binary code is a set of \(2^{K}\) codewords with length \(N\) chosen uniformly from the ensemble of all \(2^N\) bit-strings. Each bit in the codeword is randomly chosen between 0 and 1 with equal probability. For another example, a random binary linear code is generated from a random chosen \(K\) generators of length \(N\), where each bit of the generators is randomly chosen between 0 and 1 with equal probability. Equivalently, a random binary linear code is defined by a randomly generated \(K\) by \(N\) generator matrix, where each entry is randomly chosen between 0 and 1 with equal probability.

  In both of the above random code constructions, the ensemble size scales exponentially with \(N\). A common convention is to think of the resulting code constructions as effectively explicit (as opposed to random) in cases where the ensemble size is independent of \(N\) or even when the size scales polynomially with \(N\).

#protection: 'Random codes can protect against random errors, e.g. from Binary Symmetry Channel (BSC), discrete memoryless channel.'

features:
  rate: Typical random codes (TRC) or typical random linear codes (TLC) refer to codes in the respective ensemble that satisfy a certain minimum distance. The relative fraction of typical codes in the ensemble approaches one as \(N\) goes to infinity \cite{doi:10.1002/j.1538-7305.1948.tb01338.x} (see also Ref. \cite{doi:10.1109/TIT.2002.800480}). Asymptotically, given distance \(d\), the maximum rate for a TRC is given by \(R=\frac{1}{2}R_{GV}(\delta)\) where \(R_{GV}\) is the Gilbert–Varshamov (GV) bound \(R_{GV}=1-h(\delta)\), and \(h(\delta)=h(\frac{d}{n})\) is the binary entropy function. The maximum rate for a TLC is given by \(R=R_{GV}(d)\), meaning that TLCs achieve the \hyperref[topic:gv-bound]{asymptotic GV bound}.

notes:
  - 'Shannon''s pioneering work \cite{doi:10.1002/j.1538-7305.1948.tb01338.x} analyzes the distance distribution of the code given a rate. Given \(N\) and the rate \(R\), the minimum distance of a TRC is given by the \hyperref[topic:gv-bound]{GV bound} \(d=N\delta_{GV}(2R)\), where \(\delta_{GV} = h^{-1}(1-R)\), \(0\le R \le 1\), and \(\delta_{GV}(x)=0\) for all other \(R\). For a TLC, the minimum distance is given by \(d=N\delta_{GV}(R)\).'

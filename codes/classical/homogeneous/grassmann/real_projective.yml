physical: quotients

name: 'Real projective space code'

alternative_names:
  - '\(\mathbb{R}P^N\) code'
  - 'Packing in \(\mathbb{R}P^N\)'


description: |
  Encodes \(K\) states (codewords) into a real projective space \(\mathbb{R}P^N\), the space of lines in real space. The space for \(N=2\) is called the projective plane.

protection: |
  A common distance measure on real projective space is the inner product (a.k.a. coherence).
  Sets of lines with minimal inner product are called \textit{Grassmanian frames} \cite{arxiv:math/0301135}, and most of these frames are equiangular tight frames \cite{arxiv:1504.00253}.
  The Welch bound is a lower bound on the worst-case coherence of a code \cite{doi:10.1109/TIT.1974.1055219}.

    - code_id: grassmannian
      detail: 'Real projective spaces \(\mathbb{R}P^N\) are real Grassmannians \(G/H\) for \(G = O(N+1)\) and \(H = O(N)\times O(1)\).'
  cousins:
    - code_id: points_into_spheres
      detail: 'Real projective space can be obtained from the sphere by identifying antipodal points, i.e., \(\mathbb{R}P^N = S^N/\mathbb{Z}_2\). As such, real projective space codes are in one-to-one correspondence with antipodal spherical codes, with each antipodal pair of spherical codewords corresponding to one line in projective space.'

code_id: symmetric_space
physical: quotients

name: 'Symmetric-space code'


description: |
  Encodes \(K\) states (codewords) into a symmetric space, which is a homogeneous space \(G/H\) with an additional property whose definition depends on whether the homogeneous space is continuous or Finite.
  
  Infinite symmetric spaces are homogeneous spaces with an appropriately defined inversion operation. The two-sphere is a symmetric space, and its operation is inversion through the origin. This holds true in higher dimensions, yielding the \(D\)-dimensional spherical symmetric space family \(SO(D+1)/SO(D)\). 
  Cartan classified the compact symmetric spaces whose \(G\) are simple real Lie groups \cite{doi:10.24033/asens.781,doi:10.1007/978-3-642-18245-7}.
  These spaces include spheres, projective spaces, and Grassmannians.
  Noncompact symmetric spaces include Euclidean and hyperbolic spaces.

  Finite symmetric spaces are defined in coding theory as spaces admitting a \textit{generously transitive} group action, i.e., for all pairs of points \(x,y \in G/H\), there exists a \(g\in G\) such that \(g.x = y\) and \(g.y = x\) \cite[Def. 4.5]{arxiv:0909.4767}\cite[Sec. 3.4]{arxiv:1007.2905}.

 
protection: |
  The decomposition of a symmetric space into \(G\)-irreps is multiplicity free.
  Optimal codes have been formulated for quaternionic and octonionic projective spaces \cite{arxiv:1308.3188,arxiv:1904.11159}.

For multiplicity-free spaces such as symmetric spaces, the zonal spherical functions form an Abelian algebra, and the behavior of such functions can be used to obtain bounds on code parameters such as the Levenshtein bound \cite{manual:{V. I. Levenshtein, "On choosing polynomials to obtain bounds in packing problems." Proc. Seventh All-Union Conf. on Coding Theory and Information Transmission, Part II, Moscow, Vilnius. 1978.},manual:{V. I. Levenshtein, “On bounds for packings in n-dimensional Euclidean space”, Dokl.

        Upper bounds on kissing numbers can be worked out by treating the sphere as a symmetric space \cite{arxiv:math/0608426}.

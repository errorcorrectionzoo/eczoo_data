code_id: points_into_spheres
physical: spheres
logical: reals

name: 'Constant-energy spherical code'

description: |
  Code whose codewords are points on a real or complex sphere whose radius squared is called the \textit{energy}.
  Typically, only angular distances between points are relevant for code performance, so one can normalize codewords of a constant-energy code to obtain up a spherical code, i.e., a constant energy code with energy one.

protection: |
  Constant-energy codes are sphere packings constrained to lie on a sphere, meaning that they can be used to transmit information through the AGWN channel.
  For a given dimension \(n\), number of codewords \(M\), and average energy \(P\), the \textit{constant-energy Gaussian channel coding problem} asks to find a set of \(M\) codewords of energy \(nP\) that minimizes the error probability during transmission; see \cite[Ch. 3]{doi:10.1007/978-1-4757-6568-7}.

    - code_id: 2pt_homogeneous
      detail: 'Compact two-point homogeneous spaces \(G/H\) reduce to real spheres for \(G = SO(D+1)\) and \(H = SO(D)\) and to complex spheres for \(G = SU(D+1)\) and \(H = SU(D)\) \cite[Table 1]{arxiv:1007.2905}. In fact, spheres are compact three-point homogeneous spaces \cite[Sec. 6.6.1.1]{doi:10.1007/978-3-642-18245-7}.'

code_id: antiprism
physical: spheres
logical: reals

name: 'Antiprism code'

description: |
  Spherical \((3,2q)\) code for \(q \geq 2\) whose codewords are the vertices of a \(q\)-antiprism.

protection: |
  The antiprism vertices consists of two \(q\)-gon vertices with the \(q\)-gons rotated by \(2\pi/q\) degrees.
  The relative height and radii of the \(q\)-gons can be modulated while still staying on the sphere.
  For the case when the two \(q\)-gons are such that the \(q=2,3\) cases reduce to the tetrahedron and octahedron, respectively, the antiprism is a spherical 3-design for \(q \geq 3\), and a \(2\)-design for \(q=2\) \cite{manual:{V. V. Albert, private communication, 2025.}}.
  This can be seen as a consequence of \cite[Lemma 6.11]{doi:10.1007/s00010-024-01036-6}.

name: 'Linear code over \(\mathbb{Z}_4\)'

description: |
  A code that forms a subgroup of \(\mathbb{Z}_4^n\) under addition.
  More technically, linear codes over \(\mathbb{Z}_4\) are submodules of \(\mathbb{Z}_4^n\).

  Linear codes over \(\mathbb{Z}_4\) can be defined in terms of a \textit{generator matrix} \(G\), whose rows generate the \(k\)-dimensional codespace.
  Given a message (i.e., logical string) \(x\), the corresponding encoded codeword is \(G^T x\). 

  A code's generator matrix can be reduced via coordinate permutations to its \textit{standard form} 
  \begin{align}
    G=\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
    I_{k_{1}} & A & B\\
    0 & 2I_{k_{2}} & 2C
    \end{array}\right]~,
  \end{align}
  where \(A,C\) are binary matrices, and where \(B\) is a quaternary matrix. 
  Such a code encodes \(4^{k_1} 2^{k_2}\) codewords, consisting of \(k_1\) logical quaternary digits and \(k_2\) logical bits.
  It is called an \((n,4^{k_1} 2^{k_2})_{\mathbb{Z}_4}\) linear code over \(\mathbb{Z}_4\) of \textit{type} \(4^{k_1} 2^{k_2}\).
  The generator matrix forms a basis when there are no logical bits, i.e., the submodule is free if and only if \(k_2=0\) \cite{doi:10.1142/3603}.

  Two linear codes over \(\mathbb{Z}_4\) are \textit{monomially equivalent} if the codewords of one code can be mapped into those of the other under a permutation and coordinate sign flips.
  The \textit{monomial automorphism group} of a linear code over \(\mathbb{Z}_4\) is the largest subgroup of coordinate permutations and sign flips that maps the code onto itself.


protection: |
  Quaternary codes over \(\mathbb{Z}_4\) come with a Hamming distance, which is the minimum number of nonzero coordinates of a nonzero codeword.
  They also protect from cyclic shifts in each quaternary digit, which are quantified by the Lee metric.
  The Lee weight of a digit is given by \(w_L(0)=0\), \(w_L(1)=1\), \(w_L(2)=2\), and \(w_L(3)=1\), and the Lee weight of a string is the integral sum of the Lee weights of its digits.
  The code's \textit{Lee distance} of a code is the minimum Lee weight of a nonzero codeword.

  The Lee distance \(d_L\) between two strings \(a,b\in\mathbb{Z}_4\) governs how many cyclic shifts it takes to connect the two strings, and is thus related to the Euclidean distance between the vectors \(i^a\) and \(i^b\) as \(2d_L(a,b) = \|i^a - i^b\|^2\).
  Quaternary codes over the Lee metric are thus naturally mapped to QPSK codes.

  \hyperref[topic:weight-enumerator]{Weight enumerators} have also been extended to the Lee metric \cite{doi:10.1007/BF01198572}.

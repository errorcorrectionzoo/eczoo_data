name: 'Dual code over \(R\)'

description: |
  For any \(q\)-ary linear code \(C\) over a ring \(R\), the dual code over \(R\) is
  \begin{align}
  C^\perp = \{ y\in R^{n} ~|~ x \cdot y=0 \forall x\in C\},
  \end{align}
  where the \textit{ordinary}, \textit{standard}, or \textit{Euclidean} inner product is \(x\cdot y = \sum_{i=1}^n x_i y_i\) for coordinates \(x_i,y_i\).

  A code that is contained in its dual, \(C \subseteq C^\perp\), is called \textit{self-orthogonal over \(R\)} or \textit{weakly self-dual over \(R\)}.
  A code that contains its dual, \(C^\perp \subseteq C\), is called \textit{dual-containing over \(R\)}.
  A code that is equal to its dual, \(C^\perp = C\), is called \textit{self-dual over \(R\)}.
  A code is dual-containing over \(R\) iff its dual is self-orthogonal over \(R\).

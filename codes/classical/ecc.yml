description: |
  Code designed for transmission of classical information through classical channels.

  A code is a subset of a set or \textit{alphabet} \(\Sigma\), with each element called a \textit{codeword}. 
  An error-correcting code consists of \(K\) codewords over an alphabet with \(N\) elements such that it is possible to recover the codewords from errors \(E\) from some error set \(\mathcal{E}\).
  The table below lists the most common alphabets, along with names of the corresponding codewords of a block code, i.e., a code on \(n\) copies of the alphabet.
    \begin{table}
      \begin{cells}
      \celldata<c H, c H>{alphabet \(\Sigma\) & codewords}
      \celldata<c, c>{
      \(\mathbb{Z}_{2}=\mathbb{F}_2\) & bitstrings
          \\
      \(GF(q)\) & \(q\)-ary strings
          \\
      \(\mathbb{Z}_{q}\) & \(q\)-ary strings over \(\mathbb{Z}_{q}\)
          \\
      \(\mathbb{R}\) & sphere packings
          \\
      \(G\) & group elements
          \\
      \(G/H\) & cosets
      }
      \end{cells}
      \caption{Table listing the most common alphabets used in ECCs. Here, \(GF(q)\) is a \hyperref[topic:finite-fields]{finite field}, \(G\) is a group, and \(H\) is a subgroup of \(G\).}
      \label{table:alphabets}
    \end{table}

  \subsection{Finite-field alphabet}
  \begin{defterm}{Finite fields}
  \label{topic:finite-fields}
  The most common alphabets used in block codes are Galois or finite fields \(\mathbb{F}_q\), which are sets of \(q\) elements closed under addition and multiplication.
  They are finite analogues of the real or complex numbers, and a unique field exists for every power \(q=p^m\) of a prime \(p\).
  The prime-field case reduces to \(\mathbb{Z}_p\), a group under addition that is promoted to a field by defining multiplication modulo \(p\); the case \(p=2\) yields the binary field \(\mathbb{Z}_2\).
  Every finite field comes with a 0 element (additive identity), a 1 element (multiplicative identity), and additive (multiplicative) inverses for all (nonzero) elements.  
  An element whose powers exhaust all nonzero field elements is called \textit{primitive}.
  Fields come with a trace operation, the \textit{field trace}, which maps elements \(\gamma \in GF(q)\) to elements of \(\mathbb{F}_p\) as
  \begin{align}
    \text{tr}(\gamma)=\sum_{k=0}^{m-1}\gamma^{p^{k}}~.
  \end{align}
  The field trace can be thought of as an averaging over the field's Galois group, which is the cyclic group generated by \(\gamma\to\gamma^p\) \cite[pg. 113]{preset:MacSlo}.
  Fields also come with a \textit{field norm},
  \begin{align}
    N(\gamma)=\prod_{k=0}^{m-1}\gamma^{p^{k}}=\gamma^{(p^{m}-1)/(p-1)}~.
  \end{align}
  In the case of the complex numbers, analogues of the field trace and field norm are the real part and  norm squared of a complex number, respectively.

  Any field \(GF(q=p^m)\) can be thought of as an \(m\)-dimensional vector space over \(\mathbb{F}_p\) a.k.a. the \(m\)th \textit{extension} of \(\mathbb{F}_p\) (similar to the complex numbers being an extension of the reals).
  Conversely, \(\mathbb{F}_p\) is an example of a \textit{subfield} of \(GF(q)\).
  Certain field elements are chosen to be the \textit{basis} of \(GF(q)\) over \(\mathbb{F}_p\), and all other elements are expressed as linear combinations of these basis elements.
  More generally, elements of fields such as \(GF(p^{ml})\) can be written as \(m\)-dimensional vectors over \(GF(p^l)\) or \((m\times l)\)-dimensional matrices over \(\mathbb{F}_p\). 
  This idea is used to convert between ordinary block codes and matrix-based codes such as disk array codes and rank-metric codes.
  The field norm and field trace can likewise be defined for fields \(\mathbb{F}_{q^m}\) that are extensions of \(GF(q)\) for non-prime \(q\).
  \end{defterm}

  An example of a field is the quaternary Galois field \(\mathbb{F}_4 = \{0,1,\omega, \omega^2=\bar{\omega}\}\) with \(p=m=2\).
  In this case, \(\omega\) can be interpreted as a third root of unity, but more formally it is defined as a solution to the polynomial equation \(1+x+x^2=0\).
  Field elements can be represented as two-dimensional vectors with binary elements, \(\mathbb{F}_4=\mathbb{F}_2^2\), using the basis \(1\cong(1,0)\) and \(\omega\cong(0,1)\):
  \begin{align}
    0&\leftrightarrow(0,0)\cong0\cdot1+0\cdot\omega\\1&\leftrightarrow(0,1)\cong0\cdot1+1\cdot\omega\\\omega&\leftrightarrow(1,1)\cong1\cdot1+1\cdot\omega\\\bar{\omega}&\leftrightarrow(1,0)\cong1\cdot1+0\cdot\omega~.
  \end{align}
  In this way, the field elements form the Klein four group \(\mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_2\) under addition.
  One can check that the trace operation, \(\text{tr}(\gamma) = \gamma + \gamma^2\), outputs either 0 or 1 for any element \(\gamma\in \mathbb{F}_4\).

# The field trace in this case is similar to taking the real part of a complex number, \(\text{tr}(\gamma) = \gamma + \gamma^2\) for any element \(\gamma\).

# The group of isometries of \(q\)-ary Hamming space is a combination of the monomial group, the Galois group of \(GF(q)\), and the group formed by the action of the space on itself (under addition) \cite{preset:HKSclass}.

# A common family of codes are the \textit{block codes}, intended to encode a piece, or block, of a data stream.
# A block code encodes strings of length \(k\), where each character in the string an element of some fixed alphabet \(\Sigma\), into strings of length \(n\). In other words, a block code encoding is a map from \(\Sigma^k\) to \(\Sigma^n\), where \(N = |\Sigma|^n\), \(K=|\Sigma|^k\), and \(|\Sigma|\) is the number of elements in the alphabet.

    The Shannon channel capacity (the maximum of the mutual information over input and output distributions) is the highest rate of information transmission through a classical (i.e., non-quantum) channel with arbitrarily small error rate \cite{doi:10.1002/j.1538-7305.1948.tb01338.x}.
    The fault-tolerant capacity is the capacity for the more general case where the encoding and decoding maps are also assumed to undergo noise \cite{arxiv:2009.07161}.
    
    Corrections to the capacity and tradeoff between decoding error, code rate and code length are determined using small \cite{manual:{V. Strassen, “Asymptotische Absch¨atzungen in Shannons Informationstheorie,” Trans. Third Prague Conference on Information Theory, Prague, 689–723, (1962)},arxiv:0801.2242,doi:10.1109/TIT.2010.2043769}, moderate \cite{arxiv:1208.1924,doi:10.1109/ALLERTON.2010.5707068,arxiv:1701.03114} and large \cite{doi:10.1007/978-3-7091-2945-6,doi:10.1017/CBO9780511921889,doi:10.1109/TIT.1973.1055007,doi:10.1109/TIT.1979.1056003} deviation analysis.
    Sometimes the difference from the asymptotic rate at finite block length can be characterized by the \textit{channel dispersion} \cite{doi:10.1109/TIT.2010.2043769,doi:10.1109/TIT.2014.2341919}.

      detail: 'Any ECC can be embedded into a quantum Hilbert space, and thus passed through a quantum channel, by associating elements of the alphabet with basis vectors in a Hilbert space over the complex numbers.
      In other words, classical codewords are elements of an alphabet, while quantum codewords are functions on the alphabet.
      Classical codes can be unified with quantum codes using various algebraic frameworks \cite{arxiv:0910.1536,arxiv:1005.0353}.'

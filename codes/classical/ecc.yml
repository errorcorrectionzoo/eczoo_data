name: 'Error-correcting code'
#introduced: ''

description: 'A \textit{code} is a subset of a set or \textit{alphabet}, with each element called a \textit{codeword}. An \textit{error-correcting code} consists of \(K\) codewords over an alphabet with \(N\) elements such that it is possible to recover the codewords from errors \(E\) from some error set \(\mathcal{E}\).'

protection: 'A code corrects errors associated with a noise channel if it is possible to recover any codeword after its coordinates have been changed after going through the channel. More technically, an error-correcting code \((u,\mathcal{E})\) is an \textit{encoder} function \(u:[1\cdots K]\to[1\cdots N]\) with a set of correctable errors \(E:[1\cdots N]\to [1\cdots M]\) with the following property: there exists a \textit{decoder} function \(d:[1\cdots M]\to [1\cdots K]\) such that for all \(E\in\cal{E}\) and states \(x\in[1\cdots K]\), \(d(E(e(x)))=x\).'

notes:
  - 'The modern theory of error-correcting codes is rooted in the foundational work of C. Shannon \cite{doi:10.1002/j.1538-7305.1948.tb01338.x}, but error-correcting codes have been used prior to that work \cite{doi:10.1007/bf03025254}.'

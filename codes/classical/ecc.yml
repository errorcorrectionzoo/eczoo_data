name: 'Error-correcting code'
#introduced: ''

# Similar language to qecc_finite; following Gottesman's book
description: 'Encodes \(K\) states (codewords) over an alphabet with \(N\) elements such that it is possible to recover the codewords from errors \(E\) from some error set \(\mathcal{E}\).'

# Is there a universal defn of distance?
protection: 'A code corrects errors associated with a noise channel if it is possible to recover any codeword after its coordinates have been changed after going through the channel. More technically, an error-correcting code \((u,\mathcal{E})\) is an \textit{encoder} function \(u:[1\cdots K]\to[1\cdots N]\) with a set of correctable errors \(E:[1\cdots N]\to [1\cdots M]\) with the following property: there exists a \textit{decoder} function \(d:[1\cdots M]\to [1\cdots K]\) such that for all \(E\in\cal{E}\) and states \(x\in[1\cdots K]\), \(d(E(e(x)))=x\).'

description: |
  The Clifford group on \(n\) qubits is a subgroup of the unitary group \(U(2^n)\) that is the normalizer of the \hyperref[topic:pauli]{Pauli group}, that forms a unitary 3-design, and that is closely related to the automorphism group of BW lattices.
  The group features prominently in quantum information, with the rest of the entry given in that context.

  \begin{defterm}{Clifford group}
  \label{topic:clifford}
  The \(n\)-qubit Clifford group consists of the Pauli group as well as elements that permute Pauli operators amongst themselves.
  Up to any phases and Pauli strings, the group is equivalent to the symplectic group \(Sp(2n,\mathbb{Z}_2)\).
  A Clifford circuit is a quantum circuit, defined on some qubit geometry and consisting of only Clifford gates. 
  See Refs. \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/0304125,arxiv:0811.0898,arxiv:1310.6813,arxiv:1810.10259,preset:GottesmanBook} for generators, relations, and normal form. 
  \end{defterm}

  The Clifford group cannot be expressed as a semidirect product of the Pauli and symplectic groups \cite{arxiv:2406.09951}.
  Restricting the group to real-valued elements yields the \textit{real Clifford group} \cite{manual:{V. M. Sidelnikov, On a finite group of matrices and codes on the Euclidean sphere (in Russian), Probl. Peredach. Inform. 33 (1997), 35–54 (1997); English translation in Problems Inform. Transmission 33 (1997), 29–44},doi:10.1109/ISIT.1997.613373}, and including complex conjugation yields the \textit{extended Clifford group} \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/0412001}.

  Single-qubit Clifford gates, together with Paulis, realize a group with \(192\) elements.
  Modding out phases yields the \(48\)-element \(2O\) binary octahedral subgroup of \(SU(2)\).
  Further modding out the Pauli group, which corresponds to the quaternion group \(Q\), yields the permutation group \(S_3\), which consists of permutations of the three non-identity single-qubit Pauli matrices.

  The two-qubit Clifford group, modded out by the Pauli group and phases, is isomorphic to \(S_6\), and its subgroups have been classified \cite{arxiv:2409.14624}.
  
  The commutant of four-fold \cite{arxiv:1609.08172,arxiv:1609.08188} and higher transversal representations of the Clifford group consists of qubit permutations and projections onto the \([[2m,2m-2,2]]\) error-detecting code \cite{arxiv:2504.12263}.
  
  Clifford-group elements can be sampled efficiently \cite{arxiv:1406.2170}.

name: 'Classical abelian group code'
# include DOI of original paper
introduced: '\cite{}'


description: ‘An \( [n,k]_{q} \) linear code based on a finite group \( G \) of size \(
  n \). The code is a \( k \) dimensional linear subspace of the group algebra of \( G
  \) with coefficients in the field with \( q \) elements. To be precise, the code must
  be closed under permutations corresponding to the elements of the group \( G \) (thus
  this group \( G \) must be a subgroup of the permutation automorphism group of the
  code, which is defined as the group of permutations of the physical bits that preserve
  the code space).  This leads us to the formal definition of a group code; a group
  code is an ideal in the group algebra \( \mathcal{F}_qG \).  A group code for a group
  \( G \) which is abelian is called an abelian group code.’

# Is there anything you can say about protection? 
protection: 'The class of abelian group codes is very general, for example including all group codes of size \(n \leq 23 \). As such it is very difficult to say anything about the distance of abelian groups codes without specializing to a particular family’

notes:
- 'Not all abelian group codes are for cyclic groups (cyclic codes) or for elementary abelian \( p \) groups (e.g. Reed Muller codes). For example, there is a binary code with parameters \( [45,13,16] \) which is an abelian group code for the group \( G= C_3 \times C_15 \). '

      detail: 'A length \(n\) cyclic code is an abelian group code for the cyclic group with n elements \( C_n \). Note that we have an isomorphism of \( \mathbb{F} \) algebras \( \mathbb{F}C_n \cong \mathbb{F}[x]/<x^n-1> \) by taking  \( x \) to be the generator of the cyclic group. Thus we can see how cyclic codes are an example of an abelian group code.'

    - code_id: reed_muller
      detail: 'Consider a binary vector space of dimension \( m \). Under addition, this forms a finite group with \( 2^m \) elements known as an elementary abelian 2-group (it is just the direct product of \( m \) many 2 element cyclic groups \( C_2 \times \dots \times C_2 \). Denote this group by \( G_m \). Let \( J \) be the Jacobson radical of the group algebra \( \mathbb{F}_2G_m \). Then the binary Reed-Muller codes \( \mathcal{RM}(r,m) \) correspond to the ideal \( J^{m-r} \). The length of the code is \( 2^m \) (the size of the group \( G_m \) ) the distance is \( 2^{m-r} \) and the dimension is \( \sum_{i=0}^r {m \choose i} \). A similar construction exists for choices of a prime \( p \) Other than \( p=2 \).'

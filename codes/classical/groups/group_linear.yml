physical: groups

name: 'Linear code over \(G\)'
introduced: '\cite{doi:10.1109/49.29613,doi:10.1109/18.133243,doi:10.1109/18.104333}'

description: |
  Block code that encodes \(K\) states (codewords) in \(n\) coordinates over a group \(G\) such that the codewords form a subgroup of \(G^n\). In other words, the set of codewords is closed under the group operation.

  For finite groups that are not finite fields, the \textit{automorphism group} of such codes is the group \(G^n\) formed by the action of \(G\) on each coordinate as well as the coordinate permutation group \(S_n\).

  parents:
    - code_id: group_classical
    - code_id: group_orbit
      detail: 'The set of codewords of a linear code over \(G\) can be thought of as an orbit of a particular codeword under the group formed by the code. However, group orbit codes do not have to be linear \cite[Remark 8.4.3]{preset:EricZin}.'
    - code_id: block
      detail: 'Linear codes over \(G\) are linear block codes with \(\Sigma=G\).'

# - code_id: stabilizer
#   detail: 'Linear (stabilizer) codes form a large and well-studied subset of all classical (quantum) codes because features such as decoding and level of protection are typically easier to determine than those of nonlinear (non-stabilizer) codes.'

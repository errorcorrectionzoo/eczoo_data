name: 'Lattice-based code'

description: |
  Encodes states (codewords) in coordinates of an \(n\)-dimensional lattice, i.e., a discrete set of points in Euclidean space \(\mathbb{R}^n\) that forms a group under vector addition when the set is translated such that one point is at the origin. The number of codewords may be infinite because the coordinate space is infinite-dimensional, so various restricted versions have to be constructed in practice. Since lattices are closed under addition, lattice-based codes can be thought of as linear codes over the reals.

  A \(n\)-dimensional lattice-based code can be defined using a generator matrix \(G\) of rank \(n\), where the rows of \(G\) are the lattice translation vectors \(g_i\).
  Any lattice point \(x\) is a linear combination of translation vectors with integer coefficients \(c_i\), \(x = c_1 g_1 + c_2 g_2 + \cdots + c_n g_n\).
  A lattice-based code can also be defined using the Gram matrix \(GG^T\).

  The \textit{automorphism group} of a lattice is the group of all isometries that preserve the origin and map the lattice into itself.
  This group is a subgroup of the orthogonal group \(O(n)\), which is the group of isometries in Euclidean space.
  An orthogonal matrix \(U\) leaves the lattice invariant if there exists an integer matrix \(A\) of determinant \(\pm 1\) such that
  \begin{align}
  \label{eq:lattice-auto}
    AG=GU~.
  \end{align}
  The \textit{affine automorphism group} is the group obtained from adding lattice translations to the automorphism group.

  Lattices are characterized by the \textit{minimum (Euclidean) distance} \(d_{\text{min}}\) between two lattice points, the \textit{kissing number} \(K_{\text{min}}\) of nearest neighbors at each lattice point, and the \textit{volume} \(V=\det G\), which is the volume of the lattice's \textit{fundamental region} that can be used to tile all of \(\mathbb{R}^n\).

  The minimum Euclidean distance is an analogue of the minimum distance of binary codes. Half of this distance is called the \textit{packing radius}.

  The \textit{nominal coding gain} \(\gamma_{c}\) (a.k.a. \textit{Hermite parameter}) of an \(n\)-dimensional lattice is
  \begin{align}
    \gamma_{c}=\left(d_{\text{min}}/\sqrt[n]{V}\right)^{2}~,
  \end{align}
  characterizing the ratio of the level of protection to the required spatial resources.
  The \textit{density} of a lattice is the fraction of the total volume of space that is occupied by spheres of \textit{packing radius} \(\frac{1}{2}d_{\text{min}}\) centered at each point in the lattice,
  \begin{align}
    \Delta=\frac{\text{volume of one sphere}}{\sqrt{V}}~.
  \end{align}

  The covering radius of a lattice is defined similarly as above, but with the spheres' \textit{covering radius} now being the smallest one such that the spheres cover all space.
  In general, finding the covering radius of lattice is \(NP\)-hard \cite{manual:{van Emde, Boas P. "Another NP-complete partition problem and the complexity of computing short vectors in lattices." TR (1981).}}.

  The \textit{lattice quantizer problem} is to find a lattice whose \textit{fundamental Voronoi cell} \(\Pi\), the Voronoi cell at the origin, has the smallest possible normalized second moment,
  \begin{align}
    G(\Pi)=\frac{\frac{1}{n}\int_{\Pi}x\cdot x\,dx}{\text{Vol}(\Pi)^{1+2/n}}\,.
  \end{align}
  Higher-dimensional lattices yield quantizers with lower normalized second moments than the 1D integer lattice \cite{manual:{P. L. Zador, Development and evaluation of procedures for quantiZing multivariate distributions, Ph.D. Dissertation, Stanford Univ., 1963},doi:10.1109/TIT.1982.1056490}.

# Lattices are also characterized by the \textit{minimal norm} \(\mu\), which is the minimal norm of a non-zero vector in the lattice.

      detail: 'Lattice-based codes are linear codes over \(G=\mathbb{R}^n\).
      Because any orthogonal matrix leaving the lattice invariant has a corresponding integer matrix (see lattice code description), integer representations of groups can be used to obtain lattices \cite[Ch. 3, Sec. 4.2]{doi:10.1007/978-1-4757-6568-7}.'

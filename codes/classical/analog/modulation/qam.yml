code_id: qam
physical: reals
logical: reals

name: 'Quadrature-amplitude modulation (QAM) code'
short_name: 'QAM'

description: |
  Encodes into points into a subset of points lying on in \(\mathbb{R}^{2}\), here treated as \(\mathbb{C}\).
  Each pair of points is associated with a complex amplitude of an electromagnetic signal, and information is encoded into both the norm and phase of that signal \cite[Ch. 16]{doi:10.1017/9781316822708}.

  QAM schemes with \(q\) complex coordinates are often called \(q\)-QAM, and \(q\) is often a power of two in order to further concatenate with a binary code.

features:
  rate: 'Nearly achieves Shannon AWGN capacity for two-dimensional constellations in the limit of infinite signal to noise \cite[Fig. 11.8]{doi:10.1017/CBO9780511811401}.'


realizations:
  - 'Optical communication (e.g., Ref. \cite{doi:10.1109/JLT.2015.2510034}).'
  - 'Telephone-line modems: 1971 Codex 9600C and international standard V.29 used 16-QAM \cite{manual:{International Telecommunication Union-T, Recommendation V.29: 9600 Bits Per Second Modem Standardized For Use on Point-to-Point 4-Wire Leased Telephone-Tpe Circuits, 1993}}.'

      detail: 'QAM encodings often consist of lattice constellations, i.e., finite sets of points scooped out of an infinite 2D lattice.'
    - code_id: multimodegkp
      detail: 'Finite-energy GKP codes are quantum counterparts of lattice-based QAM codes in that both use a subset of points on a lattice.'
    - code_id: gray
      detail: '2D Gray codes are often concatenated with \(n=1\) lattice-based QAM codes so that the Hamming distance between the bitstrings encoded into the points is a discretized version of the Euclidean distance between the points.'

description: |
  For any dimensional lattice \(L\), the dual lattice is the set of vectors whose inner products with the elements of \(L\) are integers.

  More technically, the dual lattice is
  \begin{align}
  L^{\perp} = \{ y\in \mathbb{R}^{n} ~|~ x \cdot y \in \mathbb{Z} ~\forall~ x \in L\},
  \end{align}
  where the Euclidean inner product is used.

  A lattice that is contained in its dual, \(L \subseteq L^\perp\), is called \textit{integral}.
  The Gram matrix of such a lattice has integer entries, and its dual is contained in a suitably scaled version of itself, \(L^{\perp} \subseteq L/\det L\).
  Integral lattices are classified into \textit{even} or \textit{odd}, where the norm squared of every lattice vector is an even or odd integer, respectively.

  A lattice that is equal to its dual, \(L^\perp = L\), is called \textit{unimodular} or \textit{self-dual}.

#   A code that contains its dual, \(C^\perp \subseteq C\), is called \textit{dual-containing}.  The dual of a dual code is the original code. A code is dual-containing iff its dual is self-orthogonal.

protection: |
  The Gram matrix of \(L^{\perp}\) is the inverse of that of \(L\).
  The generator matrix of \(L^{\perp}\) is the transposed inverse of that of \(L\).

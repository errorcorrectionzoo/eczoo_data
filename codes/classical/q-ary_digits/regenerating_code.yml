description: |
  An $[n,k,d,\alpha,\beta,M]$ Regenerating Code $\mathcal{C}$ over $GF(q) = \mathbb{F}_q$ is an erasure correcting code that encodes $M$ symbols from $\mathbb{F}_q$ to a $\alpha \times n$ matrix over $\mathbb{F}_q$ with each column of the matrix treated as a coordinate of the codeword. 
  The code has the following properties:
\begin{itemize}
\item Any $k$ coordinates of the codeword can be used to recover the original $M$ symbols.
\item Any erased coordinate, i.e., the $\alpha$ symbols of that coordinate, can be recovered by contacting any $d$ other coordinates and collecting $\beta$ symbols from each one of them, where $k \le d \le n-1$ and $\beta \le \alpha$.
\end{itemize}
protection: 'Corrects upto \(n-k\) erasures on coordinates.'

notes:
   - 'The connection of such codes to distributed storage is as follows. A file of size $M$ symbols is encoded using the code and each coordinate, namely the $\alpha$ symbols of that coordinate, are stored in different geographically separated
   storage nodes. Accessing any $k$ such nodes gives back the original file. Node failures are considered erasures in the codeword and any such failed node can be regenerated by contacting $d$ surviving nodes and downloading $\beta$ symbols from each of them.'
   
  - 'For standard erasure codes, like Reed-Solomon, total download bandwidth for recovery of a single node is $k\alpha$ due to the MDS property. For regenerating codes, it is $d\beta$ which can be significantly less. 
  It was shown by network coding arguments that $M \le \sum_{i=0}{k-1}\min\{\alpha,(d-i)\beta\}$. Depending on the relative values of $\alpha$ and $\beta$, a trade-off between storage per node and download bandwidth arises.
  Two extreme points of this trade-off curve are the Minimum Bandwidth Regenerating (MBR) code characterised by $\alpha = d\beta$ and the Minimum Storage Regenerating (MSR) code characterised by $\alpha = (d-k+1)\beta$.'

name: 'Generalized Reed Solomon (GRS) code'
introduced: '\cite{doi:10.1137/0108018}'

description: 'Generalized Reed-Solomon codes are an infinite family of algebraic codes defined over the finite field \( F = GF(p^m)\) for \(m \geq 0 \) and prime \( p \). The parameters of the code are \( [n,k,n-k+1] \) where \(n \leq 2^m-1\), the number of non-zero elements in the finite field. The algebraic code exploits the bijective correspondence between \(F^k\), the \(k\)-dimensional vector space over \(F\) and \(F_k[x]\), the polynomial ring over \(F\) consisting of univariate polynomials of degree at most \(k  - 1\). Let \( (\alpha_1, \cdots, \alpha_n) \) be \( n \) distinct non-zero elements of \(F\), and let \( (v_1, \cdots, \v_n) \) be defined similarly. The message \( (c_0, \cdots, c_{k-1}) \), which can be represented as the polynomial \( p(x) = c_0 + c_1 x + \cdots + c_{k-1} x^{k-1} \), is encoded as the codeword \( ( v_1 f(\alpha_1), \cdots, v_n f(\alpha_n)) \).'


protection: 'The code can detect \( n-k \) errors, and can correct  errors \( \floor {\frac{n-k}{2}} \) errors.'

features:

  decoders:
    - 'The decoding process reduces to the solution of a polynomial congruence equation, usually referred to as the key equation.'
    - 'Decoding schemes are based on applications of Euclid algorithm to solve the key equation.'
    - 'The Berlekamp-Massey algorithm \cite{doi:10.1109/TIT.1968.1054109} \cite{doi:10.1109/TIT.1969.1054260} can also be used to implement the decoding procedure.'
    - 'Since the distance of the code is \(n-k+1\), the family of codes saturate the singelton bound. Hence these are MDS codes.'

realizations:
  - 'Commonly used in mass storage systems such as CDs and DVDs and QR codes etc.'

notes:
  - 'Generalized Reed Solomon codes contain the special case of conventiontal Reed Solomon codes. These are cyclic codes, and can also be defined by using the discrete Fourier transform. '

notes:
  - 'List decoders try to find a low-degree bivariate polynomial \(Q(x,y)\) such that evaluation of \(Q\) at \((\alpha_i,y_i)\) is zero. By choosing proper degrees, it can be shown such polynomial exists by drawing an analogy between evaulation of \(Q(\alpha_i,y_i)\) and homogenous linear equation(interpolation). Once this is done, list roots of \(y\) that agree at \(\geq t\) points.'
  - 'By Singleton bound any \(q\)-ary linear code satisfies \(d\leq n-k+1\) since deleting \(d-1\) coordinates do not result in collisions, i.e. \(q^{k}\leq q^{n-(d-1)}\). Moreover, number of zero coordinates of Reed-Solomon codes, \(n-d \leq k-1\) since \(f\in \mathcal{P}_k\), where \(\mathcal{P}_k\) denotes polynomials of degree less than \(k\). Hence, Reed-Solomon codes have d=n-k+1.'
  - 'If \(f\in \mathcal{P}_k\) with \(k<q\), then \(\sum_{\alpha\in\mathbb{F}_q}f(\alpha)=0\) which implies Reed-Solomon codes are odd-like. Hence, by adding a parity check coordinate with evaluation point \(\alpha_0=0\), distance increases to \(\hat{d}=d+1\). As a result, extension is MDS and called \([q,k,q-k+1]\) extended Reed-Solomon codes.'

  - 'Guruswami–Rudra achieved list decoding capacity of radius \(1-R-\epsilon\) by bundling plain Reed-Solomon codes: folded Reed Reed-Solomon codes \cite{doi:10.1109/TIT.2007.911222}'
  - '\([n,k,n-k+1]\) Reed Solomon code requires \(\mathcal{O}(n^2)\) operations while encoding if a straightforward matrix multiplication is employed and \(k=\mathcal{O}(n)\). Using FFT algorithm, complexity of evaluating a polynomial at \(n\) roots of unity becomes \(\mathcal{O}(n\log n)\). FFT can be generalized to finite fields and rings, which is referred as Number-theoretic Transform (NTT).  However, for some values of \(n\), which can not be factorized into small primes or do not have \(n\) roots of unity, FFT algorithm fails. Independently developed by \cite{doi:10.1109/49.1926} \cite{doi:10.1016/0097-3165(89)90020-4} and generalized by \cite{doi:10.1017/CBO9781139856065}, additive FFT solves this problem by evaluating the polynomial at \(n-1\) roots of unity when \(n\) is power of 2.'
  - 'Although using iFFT has its counterpart iNNT for finite fields, the decoding is usually standard polynomial interpolation in \(k=\mathcal{O}(n\log^2 (n))\). However, in erasure decoding, encoded values are only erased in \(r\) points, which is a specific case of polynomial interpolation and can be done in \(\mathcal{O}(n\log (n)\) by computing product of received polynomial and erasure locator polynomial and using long division to find original polynomial. Long division step can be omitted to increase speed further by only dividing the derivative of the product polynomial, and derivative of erasure locator polynomial evaluated at erasure locations.'
  - 'McEliece Public Key Cryptosystem \cite{manual:{McEliece, R.J.: A public-key cryptosystem based on algebraic coding theory. DSN Progress Report pp. 114–116 (1978).}} uses Algebraic Coding Theory to secure communications against eavesdropping attack, in which private keys are generator matrices of linear codes, i.e., \(G\). Public Keys shared to outside world are scrambled and permutated versions of \(G\), i.e., \(G^\prime=SGP\). Data to be encrypted, \(\bm{u}\), is multiplied by public key and added intentional errors \(\bm{e}\), i.e., \(x=\bm{u}G^\prime+\bm{e}\). Upon receiving encrypted data, private key owner can apply inverse permutation \(P^{-1}\) to \(\bm{x}\), decode the scrambled message given the presence of \(e\) errors and finally unscramble to obtain \(\bm{u}\). Security parameters of the system are \(n\) and \(e\), hence MDS codes, such as generalized Reed-Solomon codes may provide same security level for shorter key sizes and private key owner can decode arguably fast enough using known decoding algorithms.'
  - 'Initial construction of McEliece Public Key Cryptosystem was based on Goppa codes which are subfield subcode of GRS codes. Public Key Cryptosystem designs based on Generalized Reed-Solomon codes first proposed by Niederreiter \cite{doi:10.1002/oca.4660070108} which replaced generator matrix with parity check matrix, were proven to be insecure \cite{doi:10.1515/dma.1992.2.4.439} since public key exposes algebraic structure of Reed-Solomon code. More recent works focus on methods to mask the algebraic structure using subcodes of generalized Reed-Solomon codes \cite{doi:10.1007/s10623-003-6151-2}. Lately a key-recovery attack was developed in \cite{arXiv:1307.6458} for a variant of masking method proposed by \cite{arXiv:1108.2462}.'

name: 'Reed-Solomon (RS) code'
short_name: 'RS'
introduced: '\cite{doi:10.1214/aoms/1177729387,doi:10.1137/0108018}'

description: |
  An \([n,k,n-k+1]_q\) linear code based on polynomials over \(GF(q)\). Let \(\{\alpha_1,\cdots,\alpha_n\}\) be \(n\) distinct nonzero elements of \(GF(q)\) with \(q>n\). An RS code encodes \(\mu=\{\mu_0,\cdots,\mu_{k-1}\}\) into \(\{f_\mu(\alpha_1),\cdots,f_\mu(\alpha_n)\}\), with polynomial
  \begin{align}
  f_\mu(x)=\mu_0+\mu_1 x + \cdots + \mu_{k-1}x^{k-1}.
  \end{align}
  In other words, each codeword \(\mu\) is a string of values of the corresponding polynomial \(f_\mu\) at the points \(\alpha_i\).

protection: 'Since each polynomial \(f_{\mu}\) is of degree less than \(k\), it can be determined from its values at \(k\) points. This means that RS codes can correct erasures on up to \(n-k\) registers. The resulting distance, \(d=n-k+1\), saturates the Singleton bound.'

    - 'Gao decoder using extended Euclidean algorithm \cite{doi:10.1007/978-1-4757-3789-9_5}.'
    - 'List decoders try to find a low-degree bivariate polynomial \(Q(x,y)\) such that evaluation of \(Q\) at \((\alpha_i,y_i)\) is zero. By choosing proper degrees, it can be shown such polynomial exists by drawing an analogy between evaulation of \(Q(\alpha_i,y_i)\) and homogenous linear equation(interpolation). Once this is done, list roots of \(y\) that agree at \(\geq t\) points. The Sudan list decoding algorithm corrects up to \(1-\sqrt{2R}\) proportion of errors \cite{doi:10.1006/JCOM.1997.0439}. The Guruswami-Sudan algorithm improves that to \(1-\sqrt{R}\) \cite{doi:10.1109/SFCS.1998.743426}. A further modification by Koetter-Vardy is used for soft-decision decoding \cite{doi:10.1109/TIT.2003.819332}.'

#    - Berlekamp-Welch: 'Error locator polynomial \(E(y_i) = E(f(\alpha_i))\).'
#    - 'This problem is linearized to \(E(y_i) = N(\alpha_i)\). Using the known degrees of these polynomials \(deg_q f \leq k-1, deg_q E \leq t\), this problem becomes a set of linear equations which can be solved for \(E\) and \(f\).'
#    - 'Finally we perform \(E(y_i - f_i(\alpha_i)) = 0\) to solve for the error vector.'

  - '\([n,k,n-k+1]\) RS code requires an order \(O(n^2)\) operations while encoding if a straightforward matrix multiplication is employed and \(k=\mathcal{O}(n)\). Using the FFT algorithm, complexity of evaluating a polynomial at \(n\) roots of unity becomes \(O(n\log n)\). The FFT can be generalized to finite fields and rings, which is referred as Number-theoretic Transform (NTT). However, for some values of \(n\), which can not be factorized into small primes or do not have \(n\) roots of unity, the FFT algorithm fails. Independently developed by \cite{doi:10.1109/49.1926,doi:10.1016/0097-3165(89)90020-4} and generalized in Ref. \cite{doi:10.1017/CBO9781139856065}, the additive FFT solves this problem by evaluating the polynomial at \(n-1\) roots of unity when \(n\) is power of 2.'
  - 'Although using iFFT has its counterpart iNNT for finite fields, the decoding is usually standard polynomial interpolation in \(k=\mathcal{O}(n\log^2 (n))\). However, in erasure decoding, encoded values are only erased in \(r\) points, which is a specific case of polynomial interpolation and can be done in \(\mathcal{O}(n\log (n)\) by computing product of the received polynomial and an erasure locator polynomial and using long division to find an original polynomial. The long division step can be omitted to increase speed further by only dividing the derivative of the product polynomial, and derivative of erasure locator polynomial evaluated at erasure locations.'

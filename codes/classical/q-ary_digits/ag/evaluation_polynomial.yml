name: 'Polynomial evaluation code'

description: |
  Evaluation code of polynomials at points \({\cal P} = \left( P_1,P_2,\cdots,P_n \right)\) on an algebraic variety \(\cal X\). Codewords
  \begin{align}
    \left( f(P_1), f(P_2), \cdots, f(P_n) \right)
  \end{align}
  are evaluations of a linear space \(L\) of polynomials \(f\). If the space is taken to be all polynomials up to some degree, the code is called a \textit{Reed-Muller-type code} or \textit{RM-type code} of that degree.

  One can specify the space \(L\) by the number of variables input into the polynomials as well as the polynomials' maximum degree. One can additionally select only polynomials that have zeroes at certain points with certain multiplicities. A bookkeeping device for this data is the divisor \(D\), and the corresponding vector space of polynomials defined using the variety \(\cal X\) and the divisor is the \textit{Riemann-Roch space} \(L=L(D)\) \cite[pg. 313]{preset:HKSag}.

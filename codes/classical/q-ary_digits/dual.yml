description: |
  For any  \([n,k]_q\) linear code \(C\), the dual code,
  \begin{align}
  C^\perp = \{ y\in GF(q)^{\times n} ~|~ x\cdot y=0 \forall x\in C\},
  \end{align}
  is the row space of the parity check matrix of \(C\). Given encoding map \(\mathcal{C}\) for \(C\), the dual code is the kernel of \(\mathcal{C}\), and \(\dim C^\perp = n-k\).

  A code that contains its dual, \(C^\perp \subseteq C\), is called \textit{weakly self-dual} or \textit{self-orthogonal}. A code that is equal to its dual, \(C^\perp = C\), is called \textit{self-dual}. The dual of a dual code is the original code.

protection: 'The dual of an \([n,k,d] \) code
  is an \([n,n-k,d'']\) code, where \(d''\) is not always related to \(d\). The generator matrix of \(C^\perp\) is the parity check matrix of \(C\), and visa versa.'

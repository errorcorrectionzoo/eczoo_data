name: 'Dual Code'

description: 'For a linear code \(C\), the dual code \(C^{\perp}\) is \({y \in \mathbb{Z}_2^n | x \cdot y = 0 \forall x \in C}\).

The dual code swaps the generator and parity check matrices from the original code. Therefore, the dual of an \([n,k,d] \) code
is an \([n,n-k,d'']\) code, where \(d''\) is not always related to \(d\).'

notes:
  - 'The dual of the dual code is the original code.'
  - 'A code that is equal to its dual is a self-dual code.'
  - 'A code that is contained in its dual is a weakly self-dual code.'

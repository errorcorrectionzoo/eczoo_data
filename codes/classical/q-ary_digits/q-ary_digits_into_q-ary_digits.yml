name: 'Galois-field \(q\)-ary code'
short_name: '\(q\)-ary'
#introduced: ''

description: 'Encodes \(K\) states (codewords) in \(n\) \(q\)-ary coordinates over the field \(GF(q)=\mathbb{F}_q\) and has distance \(d\). Usually denoted as \((n,K,d)_q\). The distance is the minimum number of coordinates where two strings in the code differ.'
#the minimum Hamming distance between a pair of distinct codewords.

protection: 'The standard metric for Galois-field \(q\)-ary codes is the Hamming metric, but other metrics also exist \cite{arxiv:2212.00431}. Detects errors on up to \(d-1\) coordinates, corrects erasure errors on up to \(d-1\) coordinates, and corrects general errors on up to \(\left\lfloor (d-1)/2 \right\rfloor\) coordinates.'

features:
  rate: The rate of a \(q\)-ary code is usually defined as \(R=\frac{1}{n}\log_q K\) dits per symbol.
  decoders:
    - 'For small \(n\), decoding can be based on a lookup table. For infinite code families, the size of such a table scales exponentially with \(n\), so approximate decoding algorithms scaling polynomially with \(n\) have to be used. The decoder determining the most likely error given a noise channel is called the \textit{maximum-likelihood decoder}.'
    - 'Given a received string \(x\) and an error bound \(e\), a \textit{list decoder} returns a list of all codewords that are at most \(e\) from \(x\). The number of codewords in a neighborhood of \(x\) has to be polynomial in \(n\) in order for this decoder to run in time polynomial in \(n\).'

notes:
  - 'Tables of bounds and examples of linear codes for various \(n\) and \(k\), extending code tables by Brouwer \cite{manual:{Andries E. Brouwer, Bounds on linear codes, in: Vera S. Pless and W. Cary Huffman (Eds.), Handbook of Coding Theory, pp. 295-461, Elsevier, 1998.}}, are maintained by M. Grassl at this \href{http://codetables.markus-grassl.de/}{website}.'

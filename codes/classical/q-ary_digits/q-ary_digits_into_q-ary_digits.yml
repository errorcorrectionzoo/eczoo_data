name: '\(q\)-ary code'

description: |
  Encodes \(K\) states (codewords) in \(n\) \(q\)-ary coordinates over the field \(\mathbb{F}_q\), i.e., \(q\)-ary strings.
  Error-correcting performance is quantified by some distance \(d\), which in turn is defined using a metric.
  The default distance is the Hamming distance \(d\), the weight (i.e., number of nonzero coordinates) of the lowest-weight nonzero codeword; such codes are usually denoted as \((n,K,d)_q\).
  The corresponding Hamming metric between two \(q\)-ary strings is the number of coordinates in which they differ.
  Unless stated otherwise, the distance for this class is the Hamming distance.

  Two \(q\)-ary codes are \textit{equivalent} if the codewords of one code can be mapped into those of the other under a combination of a coordinate permutation and a permutation of the elements of each coordinate. 
  The full group of such composite permutations is \(S_q \wr S_n\) \cite[Def. 1.8.8]{preset:HKSbasics}\cite{preset:HKSclass}.

protection: |
  A code detects errors on up to \(d-1\) coordinates, corrects erasure errors on up to \(d-1\) coordinates, and corrects general errors on up to \(\left\lfloor (d-1)/2 \right\rfloor\) coordinates.
  Often, the relative Hamming distance \(\delta=d/n\) is used to compare codes of different lengths.
  A code is \textit{equidistant} if the Hamming distance between any two codewords is \(d\). 

  An analogue of the \term{Gray map} and Lee weight can be defined for codes over \(\mathbb{F}_4\) by identifying \((0,\omega,\bar{\omega},1)\) with \((00),(10),(01),(11)\) \cite{doi:10.1006/ffta.2001.0333}.
 

  \subsection{Noise channels}

  Noise channels include the symmetric noise channel, asymmetric noise channels \cite{manual:{Varshamov, R. R. "Some features of linear codes that correct asymmetric errors." Soviet Physics Doklady. Vol. 9. 1965.},doi:10.1109/TIT.1973.1054954,doi:10.1016/S0019-9958(79)90329-2,manual:{Kløve, Torleiv. Error correcting codes for the asymmetric channel. Department of Pure Mathematics, University of Bergen, 1981.},doi:10.1142/6400}, as well as insertion/deletion noise and its generalization to substring edits \cite{doi:10.1109/TCOMM.2024.3420721}.

  \subsection{Weight enumerator and four fundamental parameters}
  \begin{defterm}{Weight enumerator}
  \label{topic:weight-enumerator}
  Determining protection and bounds on code parameters can also be done using the code's \textit{weight enumerator} (cf. \hyperref[topic:quantum-weight-enumerator]{quantum weight enumerators}),
    \begin{align}
    \begin{split}
      A(x,y)&=\sum_{j=0}^{n}A_{j}x^{n-j}y^{j}\\
      A_{j}&=\text{number of wt-}j\text{ codewords}~.
    \end{split}
    \end{align}
  The weight enumerator and it's Fourier transform the \textit{dual weight enumerator} satisfy the \textit{MacWilliams identity} \cite{doi:10.1002/j.1538-7305.1963.tb04003.x,doi:10.1002/j.1538-7305.1972.tb01947.x}; see \cite[Ch. 5]{preset:MacSlo}.
  The transform between the two enumerators is called the \textit{MacWilliams transform}.
  Computing the weight enumerator is \(\#P\)-hard \cite{arxiv:cs/0304044}.

  The distance of the code is the value of the first nonzero coefficient \(A_j\), while the \textit{dual distance} is the first nonzero coefficient of the dual weight enumerator.
  The \textit{number} of the code is the number of nonzero \(A_j\)'s, corresponding to the number of distinct nonzero distances between codewords.
  The \textit{external distance} is the number of nonzero coefficients of the dual weight enumerator.
  The distance, dual distance, number and external distance make up the \textit{four fundamental parameters} of a code \cite{doi:10.1016/S0019-9958(73)80007-5}\cite[Ch. 5]{preset:MacSlo}.

  Other types of weight enumerators includes the Hamming weight enumerator, Lee weight enumerator, joint weight enumerator, split weight enumerator, and biweight enumerator \cite{preset:MacSlo}.
  \end{defterm}

  \subsection{Bounds on code parameters}
  Bounds on the parameters of an \((n,K,d)_q\) code include the Hamming a.k.a. sphere-packing bound, Singleton bound, Gilbert-Varshamov (GV) bound, Griesmer bound, Plotkin bound, Johnson bound, and various linear programming (LP) bounds; see \cite{preset:HKSbasics}.
  A code whose parameters attain the Hamming bound (Singleton bound, Griesmer bound, Johnson bound, Delsarte LP bound) is called a perfect code (an MDS code, a Griesmer code, a nearly perfect code, an \hyperref[code:univ_opt_q-ary]{LP universally optimal code}).

  \begin{defterm}{Gilbert-Varshamov (GV) bound}
  \label{topic:gv-bound}
  The Gilbert-Varshamov \cite{doi:10.1002/j.1538-7305.1952.tb01393.x,manual:{R. R. Varshamov, Estimate of the number of signals in error correcting codes, Dokl. Akad. Nauk SSSR Soviet Math. - Doklady 117 (1957), 739–741.}}, or Gilbert-Shannon-Varshamov, bound states that the maximum size \(K\) of a \(q\)-ary code with distance \(d\) satisfies
  \begin{align}
  K\sum_{j=0}^{d-1}{n \choose j}(q-1)^{j}\geq q^{n}~.
  \end{align}
  In other words, if the left-hand side of the above is less than or equal to the right-hand side, then a code with such parameters exists.
  The GV bound gives rise to the \textit{asymptotic GV bound} (i.e., GV bound in the \(n\to\infty\) limit), expressed in terms of the maximum achievable rate \(R\) and relative distance \(\delta\),
  \begin{align}
    R\geq 1-h_{q}(\delta)~,
  \end{align}
  where \(h_q\) is the \(q\)-ary entropy function,
  \begin{align}
    h_{q}(\delta)=-\delta\log_{q}\frac{\delta}{q-1}-(1-\delta)\log_{q}(1-\delta)~.
  \end{align}
  \end{defterm}



features:
  rate: 'The rate of a \(q\)-ary code is usually defined as \(R=\frac{1}{n}\log_q K\) dits per symbol. The maximum rate of a \(q\)-ary code with linear distance is lower bounded by the \hyperref[topic:gv-bound]{asymptotic GV bound} and upper bounded by the \(q\)-ary version of the MRRW LP bound \cite{doi:10.1016/0012-365X(90)90002-Y}.'
  decoders:
    - 'For small \(n\), decoding can be based on a lookup table. For infinite code families, the size of such a table scales exponentially with \(n\), so approximate decoding algorithms scaling polynomially with \(n\) have to be used. The decoder determining the most likely error given a noise channel is called the \textit{maximum-likelihood decoder}.'
    - 'Given a received string \(x\) and an error bound \(e\), a \textit{list decoder} returns a list of all codewords that are at most \(e\) from \(x\). The number of codewords in a neighborhood of \(x\) has to be polynomial in \(n\) in order for this decoder to run in time polynomial in \(n\).'
  threshold:
    - 'Threshold for large-alphabet circuits codes is higher than for Boolean circuits \cite{arxiv:2306.13262}.'

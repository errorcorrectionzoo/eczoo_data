#introduced: ''

description: |
  An \( [n,k]_{q} \) code based on a finite group \( G \) of size \(n \). A group code for an abelian group is called an \textit{abelian group code}.

  The code is a \( k \)-dimensional linear subspace of the group algebra of \( G\) with coefficients in the field \(GF(q) = \mathbb{F}_q\) with \(q\) elements. To be precise, the code must be closed under permutations corresponding to the elements of the group \( G \); therefore, \( G \) must be a subgroup of the permutation automorphism group of the code, which is defined as the group of permutations of the physical bits that preserve the code space. This leads us to the formal definition of a group code: a group code is an ideal in the group algebra \( \mathbb{F}_q G \).

#protection: 'The class of abelian group codes is very general, for example including all group codes of size \(n \leq 23 \). As such it is very difficult to say anything about the distance of abelian groups codes without specializing to a particular family'

notes:
  - 'See Ch. 16 of Ref. \cite{doi:10.1201/9781315147901} for an introduction to group codes.'
  - 'Not all abelian group codes are for cyclic groups (cyclic codes) or for elementary abelian \( p \) groups (e.g. Reed Muller codes \cite{doi:10.1007/BF01119999}). For example, there is a binary code with parameters \( [45,13,16] \) which is an abelian group code for the group \( G = \mathbb{Z}_3 \times \mathbb{Z}_{15} \). '

      detail: 'Consider a binary vector space of dimension \( m \). Under addition, this forms a finite group with \( 2^m \) elements known as an elementary abelian 2-group -- the direct product of \( m \) two-element cyclic groups \( \mathbb{Z}_2 \times \dots \times \mathbb{Z}_2 \). Denote this group by \( G_m \). Let \( J \) be the Jacobson radical of the group algebra \( \mathbb{F}_2 G_m \). Then, the binary Reed-Muller codes \( \text{RM}(r,m) \) correspond to the ideal \( J^{m-r} \). The length of the code is \( |G_m| = 2^m \), the distance is \( 2^{m-r} \), and the dimension is \( \sum_{i=0}^r {m \choose i} \). A similar construction exists for choices of a prime \( p\neq 2 \).'
#Note that we have an isomorphism of \( \mathbb{F} \) algebras \( \mathbb{F}\mathbb{Z}_n \cong \mathbb{F}[x]/\langle x^n-1\rangle \) by taking  \( x \) to be the generator of the cyclic group. Thus we can see how cyclic codes are an example of an abelian group code.'

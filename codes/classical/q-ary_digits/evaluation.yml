      Let \( \mathbb{F}_{q} \) be a finite field with \( q \) elements and \( X \) be an irreducible curve over a finite field of genus \(g\). The function field of \(X\) is denoted by \(\mathbb{F}_{q}(X)\)
          A divisor \(D\) on a curve \(X\) is a formal sum of points \(P\) on the curve \(X\), i.e. \(D =\sum_{P}n_P P\) where \(n_P \in \mathbb{Z}\setminus  \{ 0 \}\) for a finite number of points on \(X\) . Here \(n_P\) denotes the multiplicity of the point \(P\) on the curve. The degree of a divisor \(deg(D)=\sum_{P}n_P\). A divisor is called effective if all coefficients are non-negative.
          For each point \(P \in X\) and any function \(f \in \mathbb{F}_{q}(X) \setminus \{ 0 \}\), we can abstract the notion of evaluation of \(f\) at \(P\). We denote \(\nu_{P}(f)\) by local parameter and discrete valuation function \(\nu_{P}:\mathbb{F}_{q}(X) \to \mathbb{Z} \cup \{ \infty \} \). A point \(P\) is said to be a zero of multiplicity \( m \) if \(\nu_{P}(f)=m>0\), a pole of multiplicity \(-m\) if \(\nu_{P}(f)=m<0\).
          Any function \(f\in \mathbb{F}_{q}(X) \setminus \{ 0 \}\) can be associated with a so-called principal divisor. The principle divisor of \(f\) is defined as \(div(f)=\sum_{P}\nu_{P}(f)P\).
          Let \(G\) be any divisor of degree \(\alpha\) on \(X\) . Denote by \(L(G)\)  all rational functions \(f \in \mathbb{F}_q(X)\) such that the divisor \(div (f)+G\) is effective, together with the zero function.
          By the Riemann-Roch theorem, \(L(G)\) is a vector space over \(\mathbb{F}_q\) of finite dimension and its dimension is given by \(dim (L (G )) = \alpha-g +1\) , where \(g\) is the genus of \(X\).
          Given an irreducible curve \(X\) and the function field \(\mathbb{F}_q(X)\) defined over \(X\) , let \(P_1, P_2 , , P_n\)  be distinct rational points on \(X\) . The \(n\) points determine a divisor \(D = P_1 + P_2+, ,+ P_n\) . Let \(G\) be an arbitrary divisor on \(X\) such that \({P_1, P_2, , , ,P_n} \cap supp(G) = \phi\). An AG code \(C(D, G )\) is defined by the following injective mapping \(ev : L(G) \to \mathbb{F}_q^n\) with
          \begin{equation}
          ev(f)=(f(P_1),f(P_2),...f(P_n)).
          \end{equation}

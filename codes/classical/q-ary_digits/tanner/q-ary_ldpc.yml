name: '\(q\)-ary LDPC code'
introduced: '\cite{doi:10.1109/ITW.1998.706440}'

alternative_names:
  - 'Non-binary LDPC (NBDPC) code'

description: |
  A \(q\)-ary linear code with a sparse parity-check matrix.
  Alternatively, a member of an infinite family of \([n,k,d]_q\) codes for which the number of nonzero entries in each row and column of the parity-check matrix are both bounded above by a constant as \(n\to\infty\).

  A \textit{parity check} is performed by taking the inner product of a row of the parity-check matrix with a codeword that has been affected by a noise channel.
  A parity check yields either zero (no error) or a nonzero field element (error).
  Despite the fact that there is more than one nonzero outcome, \(q>2g\)-ary linear codes with sparse parity-check matrices are also called LDPC codes.

protection: |
  Non-binary cycle LDPC codes for \(q\geq 32\) can exhibit good performance \cite{doi:10.1109/ICC.2004.1312545,doi:10.1109/ITW.2007.4313042,doi:10.1109/TCOMM.2008.060527}.

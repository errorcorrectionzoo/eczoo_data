name: 'Constant Weight Codes'

description: 'Constant weight codes, also known as m-of-n codes, are codes, usually binary, of length \(n\) with minimum distance \(d\) in which all codewords have a constant Hamming weight of \(m\). The maximum number of codewords in a constant weight code is denoted \(A(n,d,m)\) and the bounds on this number are currently a topic of research. \cite{doi:10.37236/1162}'


protection: 'Binary constant weight codes with weight \(m\) are guaranteed to detect one error, as a flip in any bit will result in a vector with Hamming weight \(m-1\) or \(m+1\).'


realizations:
  - 'Code used in radio networks, namely for frequency hopping \cite{doi:10.37236/1162} '
  - 'Realized in barcodes and implemented in the United States Postal Service barcode programs POSTNET and PLANET'

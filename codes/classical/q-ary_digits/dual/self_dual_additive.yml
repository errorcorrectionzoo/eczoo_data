name: 'Self-dual additive code'

description: |
  An additive \((n,2^n)_q\) code that is equal to its dual, \(C^\perp = C\), where the dual is defined with respect to some inner product, usually the trace-Hermitian inner product.

  Self-dual additive codes that contain at least one codeword of odd weight are called \textit{Type I additive}.
  Even self-dual additive codes are called \textit{Type II additive}, existing only for even \(n\) \cite[Sec. 9.10]{doi:10.1017/CBO9780511807077}.
  Type I (type II) additive codes with length up to seven (eight) have been classified \cite{arxiv:math/0005266}.
  Much is known about codes up to length 16 \cite{manual:{P. Gaborit, W. C. Huffman, J.-L. Kim, and V. Pless, “On additive GF(4) codes,” in Codes and Association Schemes (DIMACS Workshop, November 9–12, 1999), eds. A. Barg and S. Litsyn. Providence, RI: American Mathematical Society, 2001, pp. 135–149.}}.

  Two self-dual additive codes are \textit{equivalent} if they can be mapped into each other by a map that preserves self-duality \cite{arxiv:math/0504522}.

  The minimum distance of a trace-Hermitian self-dual additive \((n,n/2\) code satisfies \cite[Thm. 33]{preset:HPRainsSloane}
  \begin{align}
    d\leq\begin{cases}
    2\left\lfloor \frac{n}{6}\right\rfloor +1 & n\equiv0\text{ mod 6 and code is Type I additive}\\
    4\left\lfloor \frac{n}{6}\right\rfloor +3 & n\equiv5\text{ mod 6 and code is Type I additive}\\
    2\left\lfloor \frac{n}{6}\right\rfloor +2 & \text{otherwise for Type I  additive codes}\\
    2\left\lfloor \frac{n}{6}\right\rfloor +2 & \text{code is Type II additive}
    \end{cases}~.
  \end{align}
  A self-dual additive code saturating the above inequality is called \textit{extremal additive}.

name: 'Dual additive code'

description: |
  For any \(q\)-ary additive code \(C\), the dual code is the set of \(q\)-ary strings that are orthogonal to the codewords of \(C\) under a particular inner product.

  The dual additive (or orthogonal additive) code is
  \begin{align}
  C^\perp = \{ y\in \mathbb{F}_q^{n} ~|~ x \star y=0 \forall x\in C\},
  \end{align}
  where the \textit{trace inner product} is \(x\star y = \sum_{i=1}^n \text{tr}(x_i y_i)\) for coordinates \(x_i,y_i\) and for \(\textit{tr}\) being the \hyperref[topic:finite-fields]{field trace}.

  A code that is contained in its dual, \(C \subseteq C^\perp\), is called \textit{self-orthogonal additive} or \textit{weakly self-dual additive}. A code that contains its dual, \(C^\perp \subseteq C\), is called \textit{dual-containing additive}. A code that is equal to its dual, \(C^\perp = C\), is called \textit{self-dual additive}. A code is dual-containing additive iff its dual is self-orthogonal additive.

  An alternative definition of dual substitutes the trace inner product for the \textit{trace-Hermitian inner product}, \(x\star y \to \sum_{i=1}^n \text{tr}(x_i y^{p}_i)\).
  Another extension for when \(q=p^2\), relevant to \hyperref[code:stabilizer_over_gfqsq]{certain stabilizer codes} and reducing to the trace-Hermitian case for \(q=4\), is the \textit{trace-alternating inner product},
  \begin{align}
    x\star y \to \sum_{i=1}^{n}\text{tr}\left(\frac{x_{i}y_{i}^{\sqrt{q}}-x_{i}^{\sqrt{q}}y_{i}}{\alpha-\alpha^{q}}\right)~,
  \end{align}
  where \(\{1,\alpha\}\) is a basis of \(\mathbb{F}_q\) over \(\mathbb{F}_{\sqrt{q}}\).
  Self-dual additive codes with respect to the trace-Hermitian (trace-alternating) inner product are called \textit{trace Hermitian (trace-alternating) self-dual additive}; similar definitions hold for self-orthogonal additive and dual-containing additive.

name: 'Self-dual linear code'

description: |
  An \([n,n/2]_q\) code that is equal to its dual, \(C^\perp = C\), where the dual is defined with respect to an inner product, most commonly either Euclidean or Hermitian.
  Self-dual codes exist only for even lengths and have dimension \(k=n/2\).

  An even (doubly-even) self-dual code is called Type I (Type II) \cite{arxiv:2112.11763,doi:10.1007/978-1-4757-6568-7}.
  Ternary (quaternary) self-dual codes are called \textit{Type III} (\textit{Type IV}), and each of their codewords has weight three (two).

protection: |
  The generator matrix of the Hermitian dual of a code with generator matrix \(G = [I_k~~A]\) is \([-\bar{A}^T~~I_{n-k}]\), where \(\bar{A}\) contains matrix elements of \(A\) raised to the \(p\)th power.
  A code is Hermitian self-dual if and only if \(A \bar{A}^{T} = -I_{n/2}\).

  The minimum distance of a Hermitian self-dual \([n,n/2]\) code satisfies
  \begin{align}
    d\leq\begin{cases}
      2\left\lfloor \frac{n}{8}\right\rfloor +2 & q=2\text{ and code is singly-even}\\
      4\left\lfloor \frac{n}{24}\right\rfloor +4 & q=2\text{ and code is doubly-even}\\
      3\left\lfloor \frac{n}{12}\right\rfloor +3 & q=3\\
      2\left\lfloor \frac{n}{6}\right\rfloor +2 & q=4\text{ and code is even}
    \end{cases}~,
  \end{align}
  except for \(n = 22\) modulo four for the second case, where the bound is increased by four \cite{doi:10.1109/18.651000}.
  A self-dual code saturating the above inequality is called \textit{extremal}.

      detail: 'Self-dual linear codes with respect to some inner product are automatically self-dual additive under the same inner product since linear codes are additive.
      In addition, quaternary linear codes are Hermitian self-orthogonal (self-dual) iff they are trace-Hermitian self-orthogonal (self-dual) additive \cite[Thm. 27.4.1]{preset:HKSquantum} (\cite[Thm. 9.10.3]{doi:10.1017/CBO9780511807077}).'

      detail: 'Binary self-dual codes are singly-even and binary self-orthogonal codes that are not doubly-even are singly-even \cite[Def. 4.1.6]{preset:HKSselfdual}.
      The minimum distance of doubly-even binary self-dual codes asymptotically satisfies \(d\leq0.1664n+o(n)\) \cite{doi:10.1109/18.605587}.'

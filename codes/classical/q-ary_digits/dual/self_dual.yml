name: 'Self-dual linear code'

description: |
  An \([n,n/2]_q\) code that is equal to its dual, \(C^\perp = C\), where the dual is defined with respect to an inner product, most commonly either Euclidean or Hermitian.
  Self-dual codes exist only for even lengths and have dimension \(k=n/2\).
  A code that is equivalent to its dual is called \textit{iso-dual}.

  An even (doubly even) self-dual code is called Type I (Type II) \cite{arxiv:2112.11763,doi:10.1007/978-1-4757-6568-7}.
  Ternary (quaternary) self-dual codes are called \textit{Type III} (\textit{Type IV}), and each of their codewords has weight three (two).

protection: |
  The generator matrix of the Hermitian dual of a code with generator matrix \(G = [I_k~~A]\) is \([-\bar{A}^T~~I_{n-k}]\), where \(\bar{A}\) contains matrix elements of \(A\) raised to the \(p\)th power.
  A code is Hermitian self-dual if and only if \(A \bar{A}^{T} = -I_{n/2}\).

  The minimum distance of a Hermitian self-dual \([n,n/2]\) code satisfies
  \begin{align}
    d\leq\begin{cases}
      2\left\lfloor \frac{n}{8}\right\rfloor +2 & q=2\text{ and code is singly even}\\
      4\left\lfloor \frac{n}{24}\right\rfloor +4 & q=2\text{ and code is doubly even}\\
      3\left\lfloor \frac{n}{12}\right\rfloor +3 & q=3\\
      2\left\lfloor \frac{n}{6}\right\rfloor +2 & q=4\text{ and code is even}
    \end{cases}~,
  \end{align}
  except for \(n = 22\) modulo four for the second case, where the bound is increased by four \cite{doi:10.1109/18.651000}.
  A self-dual code saturating the above inequality is called \textit{extremal}.

  Fixed-weight codewords of extremal self-dual doubly even binary codes whose length divides 24 form a combinatorial 5-design \cite{doi:10.1016/S0021-9800(69)80115-8}.
  The extended Golay code and the \([48,24,12]\) self-dual code are two such codes.
  It is not yet known whether a \([72,36,16]\) self-dual code exists; see \cite{doi:10.1109/TIT.1973.1054975,doi:10.1090/conm/634/12692}\cite[Remark 4.3.11]{preset:HPRainsSloane}.

  Doubly even self-dual codes have been classified up to \(n\leq 40\) \cite{arxiv:1104.3727}. 
  The \([22,11]\) and \([24,12]\) doubly even self-dual codes have been classified, and there are nine inequivalent codes with the latter parameters \cite{doi:10.1016/0097-3165(75)90042-4}.

  For ternary self-dual codes, see \cite[Remark 4.3.14]{preset:HPRainsSloane}\cite{doi:10.1016/j.ffa.2005.05.012}.
  Ternary self-dual codes have been classified for \(n=24\) \cite{doi:10.1016/j.jcta.2008.11.011} and, in the extremal case, for \(n=28\) \cite{doi:10.1090/S0025-5718-08-02194-7}.

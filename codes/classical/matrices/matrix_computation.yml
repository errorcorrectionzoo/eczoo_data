code_id: matrix_computation
physical: matrices
logical: matrices

name: 'Matrix computation code'

description: |
  Encoding that provides an extra redundancy for distributed matrix computation algorithms such as matrix multiplication. Parallelized algorithms distribute a desired computation over many nodes, and a key performance bottleneck is due to some nodes completing their individual tasks much later than other nodes. Matrix computation codes provide a layer of redundancy such that the computation can be performed without having all nodes finish their piece of the computation.

protection: 'Allows computation to complete without waiting for \textit{stragglers}, or nodes that either do not finish or finish their portion of the computation much later than all other nodes.'

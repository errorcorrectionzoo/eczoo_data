code_id: orth_spacetime_block
physical: matrices
logical: points

name: 'Orthogonal Spacetime Block Code (OSTBC)'
short_name: 'OSTBC'
introduced: '\cite{doi:10.1109/49.730453}'

description: 'The codewords are \(T\times n\) matrices as defined for spacetime codes, with the additional condition that they are orthogonal matrices. \(n\) is the number of channels and \(T\) is the number of time slots.'

# protection: ''

features:

  rate: 'The greatest rate which can be achieved is \(\frac{n_0+1}{2n_0}\) where \(n=2n_0\) or \(n=2n_0-1\). \cite{doi: 10.1109/TIT.2003.817426}'

  # encoders: ''

  # transversal_gates: ''

  # general_gates: ''

  decoders: 'Maximum likelihood decoding can be achieved with only linear processing. \cite{doi:10.1109/49.753730}'

  # fault_tolerance: ''

  # code_capacity_threshold: ''

  # threshold: ''

realizations:
  - 'Used in high data rate wireless communication.'

notes: 'If the matrix \(E-C\) where \(E\) and \(E\) are distinct codewords has minimum rank \(b\), the code has diversity order \(bn_R\), where \(n_R\) is the number of receivers. The maximum possible diversity order is \(nn_R\).'

      detail: 'The same construction without the constraint that the codeword matrices are orthogonal.'

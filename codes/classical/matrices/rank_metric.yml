name: 'Rank-metric code'
introduced: '\cite{doi:10.1016/0097-3165(78)90015-8}'

description: |
  Also called a \textit{Delsarte code}. Each codeword is a \textit{matrix} over \(GF(q)\), with codewords forming a \(GF(q)\)-linear subspace, and with the metric being the rank of the difference of matrices. The distance \(d\) is the minimum rank of all nonzero matrices in the code. Rank-metric codes on \(n\times m\) matrices are denoted as \([n\times m,k,d]_q\).

  The number of codewords satisfies \(k \leq max(n, m) M\), where \(M\) is the maximum rank of all matrices in the code. Codes that achieve this bound with equality are called \textit{Delsarte optimal anticodes}.

#  decoders:
#    - 'The method of decoding is analogous to the Berlekamp-Welch algorithm.'
#    - 'Error locator polynomial \(E(y_i) = E(f(\alpha_i))\).'
#    - 'This problem is linearized to \(E(y_i) = N(\alpha_i)\). Using the known degrees of these polynomials \(deg_q f \leq k-1, deg_q E \leq t\), this problem becomes a set of linear equations which can be solved for \(E\) and \(f\).'
#    - 'Finally we perform \(E(y_i - f_i(\alpha_i)) = 0\) to solve for the error vector.'

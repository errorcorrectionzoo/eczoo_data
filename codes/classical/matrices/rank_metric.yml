name: 'Rank-metric code'
introduced: '\cite{doi:10.1016/0097-3165(78)90015-8}'

description: |
  Also called a \textit{Delsarte code}. Each codeword is a \textit{matrix} over \(GF(q)\), with codewords forming a \(GF(q)\)-linear subspace, and with the metric being the rank of the difference of matrices. The distance \(d\) is the minimum rank of all nonzero matrices in the code. Rank-metric codes on \(n\times m\) matrices are denoted as \([n\times m,k,d]_q\).

  The number of codewords satisfies \(k \leq \max(n, m) M\), where \(M\) is the maximum rank of all matrices in the code. Codes that achieve this bound with equality are called \textit{Delsarte optimal anticodes}.
  
  Rank metric codes have become increasingly versatile in cryptography - the lower bound of the time complexity of the most efficient decoding algorithms for codes within the rank metric is \(m\)^{3}*2^{\(n\)^{2}}. This is exponentially better than the previously thought most robust attacks on cybersecurity - Information Set Decoding. With the recent discoveries of quantum search algorithms - such as Grover's Algorithm which proves that quantum computers can increase the efficiency of some decoding algorithms quadratically, and other algorithms exponentially, versus their classical counterparts - Rank Metric is promising in offering post-quantum secure encryption. It is being actively researched.

#    - 'This problem is linearized to \(E(y_i) = N(\alpha_i)\). Using the known degrees of these polynomials \(deg_q f \leq k-1, deg_q E \leq t\), this problem becomes a set of linear equations which can be solved for \(E\) and \(f\).'

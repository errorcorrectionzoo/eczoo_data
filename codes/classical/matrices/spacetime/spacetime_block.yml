name: 'Spacetime block code (STBC)'
short_name: 'STBC'
introduced: '\cite{doi:10.1109/18.887864,doi:10.1109/18.825818,doi:10.1109/18.868472,doi:10.1109/26.891215}'

description: |
  In a space-time block code, \(n\) spatially separated channels transmit symbols to \(m\) receiving channel using \(T\) time slots.
  These symbols can be arranged in a \(n \times T\) matrix where the rows correspond to the channels, and the columns correspond to the time slots.
  The codewords \(\{X\}\) making up the code are thus \(n \times T\) matrices.

protection: |
  Provides protection against errors due to thermal noise and destructive interference arising from traversing an environment with scattering, reflection, and/or refraction.

  Transmission occurs from \(n\) transmitting antennas to \(m\) receiving antennas and is performed \(t\) times.
  The typical noise model, a fading channel \cite{doi:10.1109/18.720551}, multiplies an incoming codeword by an \(m \times n\) \textit{fading matrix} or \textit{damping matrix} \(H\) and adds random (typically Gaussian) noise using an \(n \times t\) matrix \(Z\),
  \begin{align}
  X\to HX+Z = Y~.
  \end{align}
  If \(H\) is known (unknown) to the receiver, then the receiver is called coherent (incoherent).

  Decoding corresponding to choosing the codeword \(X\) that, when transformed under the channel, is closest to the corrupted output \(Y\) in the Frobenius norm,
  \begin{align}
    \min_{X\in C}\|Y-HX\|^{2}~.
  \end{align}

features:
  rate: 'A spacetime block code is said to be full rate when \(k = m t\), where \(k\) is the number of information symbolds encoded in its codewords.'

realizations:
  - 'High data-rate wireless communication, e.g., WiMAX (IEEE 802.16m) \cite{doi:10.1007/s11235-013-9846-3,doi:10.1109/JSTSP.2008.922508,doi:10.1109/MWC.2006.1678163}.'

      detail: 'Spacetime codes also use spatial and temporal diversity, but do not necessarily use blocks as codewords.'

name: 'Plaquette Ising code'
introduced: '\cite{manual:{Ziman, John M. Models of disorder: the theoretical physics of homogeneously disordered systems. Cambridge university press, 1979.},arxiv:cond-mat/0309717,arxiv:cond-mat/0312587}'

description: |
  Classical code defined on a cubic lattice in usually two or three dimensions whose parity checks are applied on the four vertices of each square.
  
protection: |
  The 2D code has parameters \([L^2,2L-1,L]\) on a square lattice of size \(L\) \cite{arxiv:2410.16250}.
  The 3D version has been studied in Ref. \cite{arxiv:1612.00060}.

description: 'Duadic codes form a class of cyclic codes which are defined in terms of their idempotents. Duadic codes come in two pairs: even-like pair and odd-like pair. For a even-like pair \(C_1\) and \(C_2\) whose idempotents are $e_1$ and $e_2$ respectively, if 1. \(e_1(x)+e_2(x)=1-\frac{1}{n}(1+x+x^2+\cdots+x^{n-1})\); 2. exist a multiplier \(
mu_a\) such that \(C_1 \mu_a=C_2\) and \(C_2 \mu_a=C_1\) are satisfied, then \(C_1\), \(C_2\) is an even-pair. There is an odd-pair associated with \(C_1, C_2\) which is \(D_1\) and \(D_2\), which is \(D_1=\langle 1-e_2(x)\rangle, D_2=\langle 1-e_1(x)\). The even-pair codes are \((n,\frac{n-1}{2})\) code; the odd-pair codes are \((n,\frac{n+1}{2})\) codes. Duadic codes exist for length \(n=\pm 1 \mod 8\).'

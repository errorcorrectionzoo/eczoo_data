name: 'Generalized Reed Solomon (GRS) code'
introduced: '\cite{doi:10.1137/0108018}'

description: 'Generalized Reed-Solomon codes are an infinite family of algebraic codes defined over the finite (Galois)
              field \(F = GF(2^m)\) for \(m \geq \). The parameters of the code are \([n,k,n-k+1]\) where \(n \leq 2^m-1\), the number of non-zero
              elements in the finite field. The algebraic code exploits the bijective correspondence between \(F^k\), the
              \(k\)-dimensional vector space over \(F\) and \(F_k[x]\), the polynomial ring over \(F\) consisting of univariate
              polynomials of degree at most \(k  - 1\). Let \((\alpha_1, \cdots, \alpha_n)\) be \(n\) distinct non-zero elements
              of \(F\), and let \((v_1, \cdots, \v_n)\) be define similarly. The message \((c_0, \cdots, c_{k-1})\), which can
              be represented as the polynomial \(p(x) = c_0 + c_1 x + \cdots + c_{k-1} x^{k-1}\), is encoded as the codeword
              \( ( v_1 f(\alpha_1), \cdots, v_n f(\alpha_n)) \).'


protection: 'The code can detect \(n-k\) bit errors, and can correct  errors \( \floor*{\frac{n-k}{2}} \) bit errors.'

features:

  #rate: 'Asymptotic rate \(k/n = 1-\frac{\log n}{n} \to 1\) and relative distance \(d/n \to 0\).'
  MDS codes: 'Since the distance of the code is n-k+1, the family of codes saturate the singelton
              bound. Hence these are MDS codes.'

  decoders:
    - 'The decoding process reduces to the solution of a polynomial congruence equation,
       usually referred to as the key equation.'
    - 'Decoding schemes are based on applications of Euclid algorithm to solve the key equation.'
    - 'The Berlekamp-Massey algorithm \cite{doi:10.1109/TIT.1968.1054109} \cite{doi:10.1109/TIT.1969.1054260}
      can also be used to implement the decoding procedure.'


realizations:
  # List and explain the different "domains" of realizations in list items.
  # Group closely related realizations into a single item. It's OK to have a
  # single list item. Each item should more or less correspond to what would be
  # said in a paragraph.
  - 'Commonly used in mass storage systems such as CD's, DVD's, QR codes etc.'

notes:
  - 'Generalized Reed Solomon codes contain the special case of conventiontal Reed Solomon codes.
     These are cyclic codes, and can also be defined by using the discrete Fourier transform. '

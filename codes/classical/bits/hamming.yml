name: 'Hamming code'
#introduced: '\cite{doi: 10.1002/j.1538-7305.1950.tb00463.x.}'

description: 'Hamming Codes are a family of linear codes with parameters \((2^r-1,2^r-r-1, 3)\) for any
 \(r\),which can detect one-bit and two-bit errors, or correct one-bit errors. The \(r \times (2^r-1) \) parity check matrix,
 \(H\), has all possible non-zero r-bit strings as its columns. The codewords are \({x|Hx=0}\).'

protection: 'Can detect 1-bit and 2-bit errors, and can correct 1-bit errors'

features:
  rate: '\(1-\frac{\log n}{n}\)'

realizations:
  - 'Commonly used when error rates are very low, for example, computer RAM.'

notes:
  - 'Has the maximum rate among binary codes for that block length and with minimum distance 3.
  Therefore, it is a perfect code, i.e, it saturates the Hamming Bound.'

      detail: 'The Hadamard code is the dual of the Hamming Code'
    - code_id: reed_muller
      detail: 'For any Hamming code \([2^m,2^m-m-1,3]\), the dual Hadamard code, when augmented with a bit
      that is always 0, gives the \(\mathcal{R}(1,m)\) 1st order Reed-Muller code. In general, R(1,m) is related to
      the duals of the Hamming code, and when \(\mathcal{R}(1,m)\) is self dual, it is directly related to the Hamming code.'

code_id: 'elliptic'

physical: 'q-ary_digits'

logical: 'q-ary_digits'

name: 'Elliptic'

description: 'Algebraic geometry codes were invented by Goppa in 1977  as a natural generalization of the RS codes. We take an algebraic curve \( \chi \)of genus \(g\) over a finite field \(F_{q} \) Then we pick some points on the Curve (points are our messages). We then evaluate a collection of functions on these points as our messages. The function set that we choose has degree \( \alpha \). The detail will be described below'

protection: 'Detects errors on up to \(d-1\) coordinates, corrects erasure errors on up to \(d-1\) coordinates, and corrects general errors on up to \(\lfloor \frac{d-1}{2} \rfloor \) coordinates.'

features:
  
  rate: 'the code is an \( [n,k=\alpha-g+1, d] \) and \( d \geq n-\alpha \)'

  decoders:
    - 'We have the standard List decoding \cite{doi:10.1.1.474.114}'

    - 'Guruswami and Sudan \cite{doi=10.1109/18.782097} proposed another list decoding algorithm for both RS codes and AG codes, and improved the error-bounding to \( n-\sqrt{n(n-d)} \)'

  encoders:
    - 'Exactly as the Standard evaluation AG codes by choosing the genus \(g=1\)'

realizations:
  - 'The Elliptic Curve Cryptography covers all relevant asymmetric cryptographic primitives like digital signatures and key agreement algorithms \cite{doi:10.1109/WOSSPA.2011.5931464}.'

  - 'Application in Network security in cloud computing \cite{doi:10.1109/ICICV50876.2021.9388629}.'

  - 'RSA in electronic commerce (E-commerce) \cite{doi:10.1109/COMCAS.2017.8244805}.'

notes:
  - 'natural generalization of the RS codes.'

  - 'Restricted version of Algebraic Geometry codes.(Elliptic curves can be viewed as genus \( 1 \) curves.'

code_id: convolutional
physical: bits
logical: bits

name: 'Convolutional code'
introduced: '\cite{manual:{Peter Elias. Coding for noisy channels. IRE Convention Records, 3(4):37â€“46, 1955.}}'

description: 'Classical codes that are formed using generator polynomials over the finite field with two elements. The encoder slides across contiguous subsets of the input bit-string (like a convolutional neural network) evaluating the polynomials on that window to obtain a number of parity bits. These parity bits are the encoded information. There are many ways to formulate these codes'

features:

  rate: 'Depends on the polynomials used. Using puncturing removal \cite{doi:10.12928/telkomnika.v10i4.171} the rate for the code can be increased from \(\frac{1}{t}\) to \(\frac{s}{t}\), where \(t\) is the number of output bits, and \(s\) depends on the puncturing done. This is done by deleting some pieces of the encoder output such that the most-likely decoders remain effective'

  encoders:
    - 'Evaluation on the generator polynomials. Can be implemented with a small number of XOR gates'

  decoders:
    - 'Decoders based on the Viterbi algorithm (trellis decoding) were developed first, which result in the most-likely codeword for the encoded bits \cite{doi:10.1109/TIT.1967.1054010}. Following, other trellis decoders such as the BCJR decoding algorithm \cite{doi:10.1109/TIT.1974.1055186} were developed later.'

realizations:
  - 'A type of convolutional code used in Real-time Application networks \cite{doi:10.5815/ijcnis.2014.07.03}.'
  - 'Mobile and radio communications (3G networks) use convolutional codes concatenated with Reed-Solomon codes to obtain suitable performance \cite{doi:10.1002/0470866969}.'
  - 'A convolutional code with rate 1/2 was used for deep-space and satellite communication \cite{manual:{Butman, Deutsch, and Miller. Performance of concatenated codes for deep space missions. 1981.}}'

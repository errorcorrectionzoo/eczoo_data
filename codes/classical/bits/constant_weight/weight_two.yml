code_id: weight_two
physical: bits
logical: bits

name: 'Weight-two code'
introduced: '\cite{manual:{R. W. Hamming, Letter, April 5, 1978.}}'

description: |
  A length-\(n\) binary code whose codewords all have Hamming weight two. Such codes provide slightly extra redundancy for storage of small-scale information such as ZIP codes or decimal digits.

  For example, the two-in-five code has a size 10, thereby providing an encoding for the decimal digits 0 through 9. Such a code detects some single bit-flips as well as unidirectional errors using the fact that each codeword is weight-two. The code fails for any sequence of flips that maintains the constant weight.

realizations:
  - 'Two-in-five, also known as the two-out-of-five code, was used in the United States Postal Service''s POSTNET barcode system as well as the Postal Alpha-numeric Encoding Technique (PLANET).'
  - 'Two-in-five code forms the numerical part of the \textit{Code 39} barcode encoding.'
  - 'Two-in-five code was used on early IBM computers \cite{doi:10.1145/1457838.1457879,doi:10.5948/UPO9781614440215}.'

notes:
  - 'See Ref. \cite{preset:HKStwoweight} on weight-two codes.'

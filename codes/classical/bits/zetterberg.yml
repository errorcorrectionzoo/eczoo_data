code_id: zetterberg
physical: bits
logical: bits

name: 'Zetterberg code'
introduced: '\cite{doi:10.1109/TIT.1962.1057682}'

description: 'Family of binary cyclic \([2^{2s}+1,2^{2s}-4s+1]\) codes with distance \(d>5\) generated by the minimal polynomial \(g_s(x)\) of \(\alpha\) over \(GF(2)\), where \(\alpha\) is a primitive \(n\)th root of unity in the field \(GF(2^{4s})\). They are quasi-perfect codes and are one of the best known families of double-error correcting binary linear codes'

protection: 'Correct at least all weight-2 errors.'

features:
  rate: 'The rate is given by \(1-\frac{4s}{n}\), which is asymptotically good, with a minimum distance of 5.'

  decoders:
#    - 'Decoding through linear-feedback shift registers.'
    - 'Kallquist first described an algebraic decoding theorem \cite{manual:{P. Kallquist, "Decoding of Zetterberg codes," in Proc. Fourth Joint Swedish-Soviet Workshop on Inform. Theory, Gotland, Sweden, Aug. 27-Sept. 1, 1989, p. 305-300}}. A faster version was later provided in Ref. \cite{doi:10.1109/18.149509} and further modified in Ref. \cite{doi:10.1109/LCOMM.2010.07.100784}.'

realizations:
  - 'Code used to provide better protection of data transmission with its double error correcting capacity \cite{doi:10.1109/TIT.1961.1057659}.'

relations:
  parents:
    - code_id: cyclic
    - code_id: binary_linear
  cousins:
    - code_id: perfect
      detail: 'Zetterberg codes are quasi-perfect, with each \(n\)-bit string at most three bit-flips away from a codeword \cite{doi:10.1109/18.149509}.'

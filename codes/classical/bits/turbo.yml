code_id: turbo
physical: bits
logical: bits

name: 'Turbo code'
introduced: '\cite{doi:10.1109/ICC.1993.397441}'

description: 'Codes with composite structure, where information bits are encoded with many different component codes. Between encodings, these codes are permuted in an interleaving fashion.'

protection: 'Parallel concatenated turbo codes have typical minimum distance with upper bound \(O(\log(n))\). Truhachev, Lentmacher, and Zignagirov produced a sequence of turbo codes with minimum distance \(\Theta(\log(n))\). \cite{doi:10.1109/ISIT.2002.1023356}'

features:

  rate: 'The natural weight of a turbo code is \(R = 1/3\). The rate of transmission can be changed depending on the method of puncturing removal \cite{doi:10.12928/telkomnika.v10i4.171}.'

  encoders:
    - 'Many choices can be made in encoding, including how to achieve termination and whether tail bits are transmitted or not, and choice of permutation.'

  decoders:
    - ''

  threshold:
    - 'Berrou et al. achieved performance on turbo codes which was \(0.7dB\) from Shannon''s channel capacity limit. \cite{doi:10.1109/ICC.1993.397441}'


realizations:
  - 'Turbo codes are recommended in Consultative Committee on Space Data Systems (CCDJS) ( \cite{doi:10.2514/6.2002-T5-11}'
  - 'Turbo codes are used in several standards related to wireless communication, including W-CDMA, DVB-RCS, TD-SCDMA, 802.16, and cdma2000\cite{doi:10.1109/JPROC.2007.895197}'

      detail: 'The inner encoder of a turbo code is historically a convolutional code. \cite{doi:10.5555/1795974}'

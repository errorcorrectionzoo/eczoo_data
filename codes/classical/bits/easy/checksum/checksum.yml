short_name: 'Checksum'
introduced: '\cite{doi:10.17487/RFC1071}'

description: |
  A classical error-detection method that treats data as a sequence of numerical values and computes their sum. In most network protocols, the data is divided into equal-sized segments (typically 16-bit words) and added together using 1's complement arithmetic. The final sum is then bitwise complemented to generate the checksum value.
  At the receiver's end, the same 1's complement addition is performed on all received data segments plus the transmitted checksum. If the result of this addition is a word consisting of all ones (which corresponds to zero in 1's complement arithmetic), the data is considered error-free.

protection: |
  Detects all single-bit errors and any burst error up to the length of the checksum. However, it is unable to detect errors that do not change the arithmetic sum, such as the reordering of data segments (transpositions) or the addition of zero-valued blocks.

realizations:
  - 'Used extensively in the internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) for headers and data integrity as defined in RFC 1071 \cite{doi:10.17487/RFC1071}.'
  - 'Advanced variants like the Fletcher checksum \cite{doi:10.1109/TCOMM.1982.1095369} and Adler-32 include positional information to detect transposition errors.'

notes:
  - 'For a detailed explanation of the 1s complement arithmetic used in the Internet Checksum, see the University of Washington lecture notes \cite{manual:{Wetherall, David. "Error Detection & Correction," CSEP 561, University of Washington, 2010.}}.'

      detail: 'Checksums are computationally simpler and often implemented in software, whereas CRCs provide stronger protection against burst errors and are typically implemented in hardware.'

physical: bits
logical: bits

name: 'One-hot code'
#introduced: ''

description: |
  Also known as an \textit{\(1\)-in-\(n\)} code. A length-\(n\) binary code whose codewords are those with Hamming weight one. The reverse of this code, where all codewords have Hamming weight \(n-1\) is called a \textit{one-cold} code.

realizations:
  - 'The bi-quinary code, a combination of one-hot 1-in-2 and 1-in-5 one-hot codes to encode decimal digits, was used in several early computers (\cite{doi:10.1201/9781315115870}, Ch. 27).'
  - 'Marking the state of a finite automaton \cite{doi:10.1109/43.41505}.'
  - 'Used in machine-learning based classification tasks because one-hot encodings, as opposed to integer encodings, do not presume an order \cite{doi:10.5120/ijca2017915495}.'

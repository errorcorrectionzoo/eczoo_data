description: 'Traceability codes are codes with combinatorial properties that trace sources of leaks of sensitive information \cite{doi:10.1.1.22.8278}. Codes with strong traceability traces at least one member of a group that has constructed a pirate decoder \cite{doi:10.1109/18.915661}. A pirate decoder is a generic pirate decryption process \cite{doi:10.1.1.22.8278}. A code with weak traceability has the ability to ensure that no group is able to frame another user \cite{doi:10.1109/18.915661}.'

protection: 'Protects materials that have be copyrighted by providing the ability to trace potential leaks as well as aids in helping to ensure an innocent party can not be framed for the pirated information \cite{doi:10.1109/18.915661}. Additionally, having this ability will help to deter pirates, help to identify pirates to then take legal action, and also codes with this ability can be used to disable pirates \cite{doi:10.1.1.22.8278}.'

features:

  # The fields below relate to specific properties of the code that are worth
  # noting. In some cases (see below), there might be multiple pieces of
  # information associated with a field (e.g., mutliple encoders/decoders,
  # multiple facts about fault tolerance, etc.); in such cases, the field
  # accepts a list of text entries, with one item per piece of information.
  #
  # Any fields below should be omitted if they do not apply.

  threshold:
    - 'Suppose n is the number of users, k is the number of users known by the pirates, and p is the probability that the pirates cannot be traced. An open (public) resilient scheme using a hash function has the personal keys of the users consisting of O(k^{2}log n) descryption keys which is the amount of decryptions needed to reveal the information. The amount of data redundancy overhead is about O(k^{4}log n) \cite{doi:10.1.1.22.8278}.'
    - 'Suppose n, k, and p are as above. A secret resilient scheme using a hash function has the personal keys of the users consisting of O(k log(n/p)) decryption keys which is the amount of decryptions needed to reveal the information. The amount of data redundancy overhead is about O(k^{2} log(n/p)).'
    - 'Suppose n, k, and p are as above. A threshold (secret) scheme using a hash function that is successful against pirates which decrpt with greater probability than paramter q, has the personal keys of the users consisting of (4k/3q)log(n/p) decryption keys. Note that this is the same as in the secret resilient schreme above. These types of schemes only need O(1) decryption operation performed by users to decrypt the information successfully. Finally, the amount of data redundancy overhead is 4k encrypted keys which is a large improvement compared to the above \cite{doi:10.1.1.22.8278}.'

realizations:
  # List and explain the different "domains" of realizations in list items.
  # Group closely related realizations into a single item. It's OK to have a
  # single list item. Each item should more or less correspond to what would be
  # said in a paragraph.

notes:
  - 'Fully resilient schemes guarantee to trace the source of any piracy \cite{doi:10.1.1.22.8278}.'
  - 'Threshold schemes have a parameter of the scheme, say q, for which the scheme only traces sources of pirate decoders that decrypt with greater probability than q \cite{doi:10.1.1.22.8278}.'
  - 'Secret schemes are those that have their decryption scheme and keys as secret. The open schemes are those that the decryption schemes and decryption keys are public information \cite{doi:10.1.1.22.8278}.'

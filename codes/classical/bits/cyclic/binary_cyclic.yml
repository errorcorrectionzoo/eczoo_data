description: |
  A binary code of length \(n\) is cyclic if, for each codeword \(c_1 c_2 \cdots c_n\), the cyclically shifted string \(c_n c_1 \cdots c_{n-1}\) is also a codeword. A cyclic code is called \textit{primitive} when \(n=2^r-1\) for some \(r\geq 2\). A \textit{shortened cyclic code} is obtained from a cyclic code by taking only codewords with the first \(j\) zero entries, and deleting those zeroes.

protection: 'Shift bound \cite{doi:10.1109/TIT.1986.1057134} gives a lower bound on the distance of cyclic binary codes.'

#  \subsection{Binary-cyclic-to-polynomial correspondence}

#  \begin{defterm}{binary-cyclic-to-polynomial correspondence}
#  Cyclic codes and their properties can be naturally formulated using the theory of polynomials.
#  Cyclic codes correspond to ideals in a particular polynomial ring. Codewords \(c_1 c_2 \cdots c_n\) of a binary code can be thought of as coefficients in a polynomial \(c(x)=c_1+c_2 x+\cdots+c_n x^{n-1}\) in the set of polynomials with binary coefficients, \(\mathbb{F}_2[x]\) with \(\mathbb{F}_2=GF(2)\). Polynomials corresponding to codewords of a linear cyclic code form an \textit{ideal} (i.e., are closed under multiplication and addition) in the ring \(\mathbb{F}_2[x]/(x^n-1)\) (i.e., the set of equivalence classes of polynomials congruent modulo \(x^n-1\)). Multiplication of a codeword polynomial \(c(x)\) by \(x\) in such a ring corresponds to a cyclic shift of the corresponding codeword string.
#  \end{defterm}

#  Codeword polynomials of a cyclic code can be generated, via multiplication, by a \textit{generator polynomial} \(g(x)\). A particular generator polynomial \(e(x)\) has the additional property of being \textit{idempotent}, i.e., \(e(x)^2=e(x)\). Given a generator polynomial, the corresponding \textit{check polynomial} \(h(x)=(x^n-1)/g(x)\) yields zero when multiplying a codeword polynomial. Its coefficients correspond to the code's parity check matrix.

#  Odd-length cyclic codes can also be defined in terms of zeroes of their generator polynomial. Since \(g(x)\) is a polynomial over the binary field, it can be factorized over some potentially larger \textit{splitting field} (just like \(x^2+1\) can be factorized over the complex numbers but not the reals). Roots of \(g(x)\) are called \textit{zeroes} of the code, and they are all powers of a primitive \(n\)th root of unity because \(g(x)\) is a divisor of \(x^n-1\). Since the generator polynomial generates all codeword polynomials \(c(x)\) by multiplication by \(x\), its zeroes are also zeroes of those polynomials.

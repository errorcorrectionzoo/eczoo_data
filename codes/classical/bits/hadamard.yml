      detail: 'For any Hamming code \([2^m,2^m-m-1,3]\), the dual Hadamard code, when augmented with a bit
      that is always 0, gives the RM\((1,m)\) code. In general, RM\((1,m)\) is related to
      the duals of the Hamming code, and when RM\((1,m)\) is self-dual, it is directly related to the Hamming code.'

      detail: 'For any Hamming code \([2^m,2^m-m-1,3]\), the dual Hadamard code, when augmented with a bit
      that is always 0, gives the RM\((1,m)\) code. In general, RM\((1,m)\) is related to
      the duals of the Hamming code, and when RM\((1,m)\) is self dual, it is directly related to the Hamming code.'

physical: bits
logical: bits

name: 'Single parity-check code'

description: 'An \([n,n-1,2]\) binary linear error-detecting code encoding an \(n\)-bit codeword into an \((n+1)\)-bit string. In this code, parity information of a codeword is sotred in an extra parity bit. If the Hamming weight of a codeword is odd, then its parity is 1. If the Hamming weight of a codeword is even, then its parity is 0. This code is inexpensive since it only requires an extra parity bit and a single parity check. '

protection: 'This code cannot protect information, it can only detect 1-bit error.'

features:
  rate: 'The code rate is \(\frac{n}{n+1}\to 1\) as \(n\to\infty\). The code distance is 2.'

  encoders:
    - 'Concatenate the codeword with a parity bit which encodes the parity information of codeword.'

  decoders:
    - 'If the receiver finds that the parity information of a codeword disagrees with the parity bit, then the receiver will discard the information and request a resend.'

realizations:
  - 'Can be realized on almost every communication device.'

relations:
  parents:
    - code_id: parity_check
      detail: ''

  cousins:
    - code_id: repetition
      detail: 'Repetition code is dual to the single-parity check code.'

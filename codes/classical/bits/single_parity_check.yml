name: 'Single parity check code'


description: 'Single parity check code is an error-detecting code, which encode a \(n\)-bit codeword into a \((n+1)\)-bit string. It is a \([n,n-1,2]\) classical code. The basic idea is to store the parity information of a codeword into an extra parity bit. If the Hamming weight of a codeword is odd, then its parity is 1. If the Hamming weight of a codeword is even, then its parity is 0. This code inexpensive since it only requires an extra parity bit and single parity check. '

protection: 'This code cannot protect information, it can only detect 1-bit error.'


features:


  rate: 'The code rate is \(\frac{n}{n+1}\). The code distance is 2. Code rate will converge to 1 if we take \(n\rightarrow \infty\).'

  
  encoders: 
    - 'Concatenate the codeword with a parity bit which encodes the parity information of codeword.'

  decoders:
    - 'If the receiver find the parity information of codeword disagree with the parity bit, then the receiver will discard the information and request a resend.'


realizations:
  - 'Can be realize on almost every communication device.'

notes:
  - 'Its parity check matrix is the generator matrix of repetition code. \([n,n-1,2]\) single-parity check code is dual to \([n,1,n]\) repetition code.'

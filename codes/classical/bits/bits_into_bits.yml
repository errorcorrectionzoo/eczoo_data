description: 'Encodes \(K\) states (codewords) in \(n\) binary coordinates and has distance \(d\). Usually denoted as \((n,K,d)\). The distance is the minimum Hamming distance between a pair of distinct codewords.'

protection: |
  A binary code \(C\) \textit{corrects} \(t\) errors if
  \begin{align}
    \forall x \in C~,~D(x,x+y) < D(x' , x+y)
  \end{align}
  for all codewords \(x' \neq x\) and all \(y\) such that \(|y|=t\), where \(D\) is the Hamming distance and \(|y| = D(y,0) \). A code corrects \(t\) errors if and only if \(d \geq 2t+1\), i.e., a code corrects errors on \(t \leq \left\lfloor (d-1)/2 \right\rfloor\) coordinates. In addition, a code detects errors on up to \(d-1\) coordinates, and corrects erasure errors on up to \(d-1\) coordinates.

features:
  decoders:
    - 'For few-bit codes (\(n\) is small), decoding can be based on a lookup table. For infinite code families, the size of such a table scales exponentially with \(n\), so approximate decoding algorithms scaling polynomially with \(n\) have to be used. The decoder determining the most likely error given a noise channel is called the \textit{maximum-likelihood decoder}.'
    - 'Given a received string \(x\) and an error bound \(e\), a \textit{list decoder} returns a list of all codewords that are at most \(e\) from \(x\) in Hamming distance. The number of codewords in a neighborhood of \(x\) has to be polynomial in \(n\) in order for this decoder to run in time polynomial in \(n\).'

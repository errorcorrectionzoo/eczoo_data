description: |
  Encodes \(K\) states (codewords) in \(n\) binary coordinates and has distance \(d\). Usually denoted as \((n,K,d)\). The distance is the minimum Hamming distance between a pair of distinct codewords.

  The coordinate permutation group \(S_n\) of order \(n!\) is formed by \(n\)-dimensional matrices with a 1 in each row and column \cite[Ch. 8]{preset:MacSlo}\cite[Ch. 3]{doi:10.1007/978-1-4757-6568-7}.
  The group of isometries of Hamming space is the hyperoctahedral group \(\mathbb{Z}_2\wr S_n=\mathbb{Z}_2^n\rtimes S_n\), i.e., the permutation group together with the group formed by the action of binary space on itself (under addition).
  Two binary codes are \textit{equivalent} if the codewords of one code can be mapped into those of the other under a hyperoctahedral group element \cite[Def. 1.8.8]{preset:HKSbasics}\cite{preset:HKSclass}.
  Determining equivalence of two codes can be done by putting each in a canonical form and mapping to a graph isomorphism problem \cite{doi:10.1007/3-540-28991-7}.

protection: |
  A binary code \(C\) \textit{corrects} \(t\) errors in the Hamming distance if
  \begin{align}
    \forall x \in C~,~D(x,x+y) < D(x' , x+y)
  \end{align}
  for all codewords \(x' \neq x\) and all \(y\) such that \(|y|=t\), where \(D\) is the \textit{Hamming distance} and \(|y| = D(y,0) \). A code corrects \(t\) errors if and only if \(d \geq 2t+1\), i.e., a code corrects errors on \(t \leq \left\lfloor (d-1)/2 \right\rfloor\) coordinates.
  The number of correctable errors is called the \textit{decoding radius}, and it is upper bounded by half of the distance.
  In addition, a code detects errors on up to \(d-1\) coordinates, and corrects erasure errors on up to \(d-1\) coordinates.

  A binary code \(C\) is \textit{distance invariant} if it has the same the Hamming weight distribution as that of its translates \(c + C\) for all codewords \(c\).
  

# The \textit{dual distance} of a binary code is the number of the first nonzero coefficient in the \(\mathbb{Z}_2\) Fourier transform of the code's distance distribution \cite[Ch. 5]{preset:MacSlo}.


features:
  rate: 'The rate of a binary code is usually defined as \(R=\frac{1}{n}\log_{2}K\) bits per symbol.
  The maximum rate of a binary code with linear distance is upper bounded by the McEliece, Rodemich, Rumsey and Welch (MRRW) bound \cite{doi:10.1109/TIT.1977.1055688} (see Refs. \cite{doi:10.1007/s00454-008-9128-0,doi:10.1137/S0895480102408353,arxiv:2104.14587,arxiv:2303.16619} for other proofs).'

  general_gates:
    - 'The group of reversible binary operations is the permutation group \(S_{2^n}\) of all possible \(n\)-bit strings. Reversible gate sets have been classified \cite{arxiv:1504.05155}.'

  decoders:
    - 'For few-bit codes (\(n\) is small), decoding can be based on a lookup table. For infinite code families, the size of such a table scales exponentially with \(n\), so approximate decoding algorithms scaling polynomially with \(n\) have to be used. The decoder determining the most likely error given a noise channel is called the \textit{maximum-likelihood decoder}.'
    - 'Given a received string \(x\) and an error bound \(e\), a \textit{list decoder} returns a list of all codewords that are at most \(e\) from \(x\) in Hamming distance. The number of codewords in a neighborhood of \(x\) has to be polynomial in \(n\) in order for this decoder to run in time polynomial in \(n\).'

      detail: 'Any binary code can be embedded into a qubit Hilbert space, and thus passed through a qubit channel, by associating length-\(n\) bitstrings with basis vectors in a Hilbert space over \(\mathbb{Z}_2^n\).
      For example, a bit of information can be embedded into a two-dimensional vector space by associating the two bit values with two basis vectors for the space.'

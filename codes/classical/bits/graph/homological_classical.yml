description: |
  A code whose parity-check matrix forms the incidence matrix of a graph.
  This code's properties are derived from the size two chain complex associated with the graph.

  Let \(G\) be a finite, undirected, connected graph without loops and multiple edges.
  Let \(r\) be its number of vertices and \(n\) be its number of edges.
  Its parity check matrix \(H\) is an \(r \times n\) matrix whose rows are indexed by the vertices of \(G\), and whose columns are indexed by the edges of \(G\).
  The matrix element \(H_{ij}=1\) if vertex \(i\) belongs to the edge \(j\) and \(H_{ij}=0\) otherwise.

# Given a connected simplicial (no self loops or muliedges) graph \(G = (V, E)\), which is not a tree, with incidence matrix \(\Gamma\) we can construct a code by choosing a parity check matrix which consists of all the linearly independent rows of \(\Gamma\).

protection: |
  The rate is \(k=n-r+1\) \cite{doi:10.1007/978-3-642-01877-0_21}.

  More generally, an \([n,k,d]\) cycle code constructed out of a graph with \(n = |E|\), \(k = 1 - \mathcal{X}(G) = 1-|V|+|E|\), where \( \mathcal{X}(G)\) is the euler characteristic of the graph.
  The code distance is equal to the shortest size of a cycle, guaranteed to exist since \(G\) is not a tree.

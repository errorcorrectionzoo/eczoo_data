description: |
  A code whose parity-check matrix forms the incidence matrix of a graph.
  This code's properties are derived from the size two chain complex associated with the graph.

  Let \(G\) be a finite, undirected, connected graph without loops and multiple edges.
  Let \(|V|\) be its number of vertices and \(|E|\) be its number of edges.
  Its parity check matrix \(H\) is an \(|V| \times |E|\) matrix whose rows are indexed by the vertices of \(G\), and whose columns are indexed by the edges of \(G\).
  The matrix element \(H_{ij}=1\) if vertex \(i\) belongs to the edge \(j\) and \(H_{ij}=0\) otherwise.

# Given a connected simplicial (no self loops or muliedges) graph \(G = (V, E)\), which is not a tree, with incidence matrix \(\Gamma\) we can construct a code by choosing a parity check matrix which consists of all the linearly independent rows of \(\Gamma\).

protection: |
  More generally, an \([n,k,d]\) cycle code constructed out of a graph with \(n = |E|\), \(k = 1 - \mathcal{X}(G) = 1-|V|+|E|\), where \( \mathcal{X}(G)\) is the euler characteristic of the graph \cite{doi:10.1007/978-3-642-01877-0_21}.
  The code distance is equal to the shortest size of a cycle, guaranteed to exist since \(G\) is not a tree.

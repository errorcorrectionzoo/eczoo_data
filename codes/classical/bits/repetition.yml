code_id: repetition
physical: bits
logical: bits

name: 'Binary repetition code'
introduced: '\cite{doi:10.1201/9781315147901}'

description: '\([n,1,n]\) binary linear code encoding one bit of information into an \(n\)-bit string. The length \(n\) needs to be an odd number, since the receiver will pick the majority to recover the information. The idea is to increase the code distance by repeating the logical information several times. It is a \((n,1)\)-Hamming code.'

protection: 'Detects errors on up to \(\frac{n-1}{2}\) coordinates, corrects erasure errors on up to \(\frac{n-1}{2}\) coordinates. The generator matrix is \(G=\left[\begin{smallmatrix}1 & 1&\cdots& 1 & 1 \end{smallmatrix}\right]\).'

features:
  rate: 'Code rate is \(\frac{1}{n}\), code distance is \(n\).'

  decoders:
    - 'Calculate the Hamming weight \(d_H\) of the code. If \(d_H\leq \frac{n-1}{2}\), decode the code as 0. If \(d_H\geq \frac{n+1}{2}\), decode the code as 1.'


  threshold:
    - 'Suppose each bit has probability \(p\) of being received correctly, independent for each bit. The probability that a repetition code is received correctly is \(\sum_{k=0}^{(n-1)/2}\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}p^{n-k}(1-p)^{k}\). If \(\frac{1}{2}\leq p\), then people can always increase the probability of success by increasing the number of physical bit \(n\).'

realizations:
  - 'Repetition codes were used in magnetic disks.'
  - 'Although classical repetition code does not have many real-world applications, it still inspire the studies of quantum error correction. Quantum repetition code is widely studied in quantum computing community.'

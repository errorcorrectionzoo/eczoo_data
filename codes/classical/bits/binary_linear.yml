description: 'An \((n,2^k,d)\) linear code is denoted as \([n,k,d]\). Its codewords form a linear subspace, i.e., for any codewords \(x,y\), \(x+y\) is also a codeword. Often defined in terms of a \textit{generator matrix} \(G\), whose rows form a basis for the \(k\)-dimensional codespace. Given a codeword \(x\), the corresponding encoded codeword is \(G^T x\).'

protection: |
  Distance \(d\) of a linear code is the number of nonzero entries in the (nonzero) codeword with the smallest such number. Corrects any error set for which no two elements of the set add up to a codeword.

  Linear codes admit a \textit{parity check matrix} \(H\), whose columns make up the set of \textit{parity checks}, i.e., the maximal linearly independent set of vectors that are in the kernel of \(G\). It follows that
  \begin{align}
    G H^{\text{T}} = 0 \mod 2~.
  \end{align}

features:
  rate: 'A family of linear codes \(C_i = [n_i,k_i,d_i]\) is \textit{asymptotically good} if the asymptotic rate \(\lim_{i\to\infty} k_i/n_i\) and asymptotic distance \(\lim_{i\to\infty} d_i/n_i\) are both positive.'

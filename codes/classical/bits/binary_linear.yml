description: |
  An \((n,2^k,d)\) linear code is denoted as \([n,k]\) or \([n,k,d]\), where \(d\) is the code's distance. Its codewords form a linear subspace, i.e., for any codewords \(x,y\), \(x+y\) is also a codeword. A code that is not linear is called \textit{nonlinear}.

  Linear codes can be defined in terms of a \textit{generator matrix} \(G\), whose rows form a basis for the \(k\)-dimensional codespace. Given a codeword \(x\), the corresponding encoded codeword is \(G^T x\). The generator matrix can be reduced via coordinate permutations to its \textit{standard} or \textit{systematic form} \(G = [I_k~A]\), where \(I_k\) is a \(k\times k\) identity matrix and \(A\) is a \(k \times (n-k)\) binary matrix.

protection: |
  Distance \(d\) of a linear code is the number of nonzero entries in the (nonzero) codeword with the smallest such number. Corrects any error set for which no two elements of the set add up to a codeword.

  Linear codes admit a \textit{parity check matrix} \(H\), whose columns make up a set of \textit{parity checks}, i.e., a maximal linearly independent set of vectors that are in the kernel of \(G\). It follows that
  \begin{align}
    G H^{\text{T}} = 0 \mod 2~.
  \end{align}

features:
  rate: 'A family of linear codes \(C_i = [n_i,k_i,d_i]\) is \textit{asymptotically good} if the asymptotic rate \(\lim_{i\to\infty} k_i/n_i\) and asymptotic distance \(\lim_{i\to\infty} d_i/n_i\) are both positive.'

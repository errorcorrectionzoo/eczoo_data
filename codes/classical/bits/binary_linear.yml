description: |
  An \((n,2^k,d)\) linear code is denoted as \([n,k]\) or \([n,k,d]\), where \(d\) is the code's distance. Its codewords form a linear subspace, i.e., for any codewords \(x,y\), \(x+y\) is also a codeword. A code that is not linear is called \textit{nonlinear}.

  Linear codes can be defined in terms of a \textit{generator matrix} \(G\), whose rows form a basis for the \(k\)-dimensional codespace. Given a codeword \(x\), the corresponding encoded codeword is \(G^T x\). The generator matrix can be reduced via coordinate permutations to its \textit{standard} or \textit{systematic form} \(G = [I_k~A]\), where \(I_k\) is a \(k\times k\) identity matrix and \(A\) is a \(k \times (n-k)\) binary matrix.

protection: |
  Distance \(d\) of a linear code is the number of nonzero entries in the (nonzero) codeword with the smallest such number. Corrects any error set for which no two elements of the set add up to a codeword.

  Linear codes admit a \textit{parity check matrix} \(H\), whose columns make up a set of \textit{parity checks}, i.e., a maximal linearly independent set of vectors that are in the kernel of \(G\). It follows that
  \begin{align}
    G H^{\text{T}} = 0 \mod 2~.
  \end{align}
  
  Definition of Tanner graph: Tanner graph is a bipartite graph used to state constraints or equations which specify error correcting codesã€‚Tanner graphs are partitioned into subcode nodes and digit nodes. For linear block codes, the subcode nodes denote rows of the parity-check matrix \( H\). The digit nodes represent the columns of the matrix \( H\). An edge connects a subcode node to a digit node if a nonzero entry exists in the intersection of the corresponding row and column.

  Tanner graph which is related to the homological construction for some classical linear codes \cite{arXiv:quant-ph/0605094}, see homological_classical. However, not all linear codes have homological construction, there is a family of classical homological codes saturating the Hamming bound.
  A \textit{chain complex} of size three is given by binary vector spaces \(A_2\), \(A_1\), \(A_0\) and binary matrices \(\partial_{i=1,2}\) (called \textit{boundary operators}) \(A_i\) to \(A_{i-1}\) that satisfy \(\partial_1 \partial_2 = 0\). Such a complex is typically denoted as
  \begin{align}
  A_2 \xrightarrow{\partial_2} A_1 \xrightarrow{\partial_1} A_0~.
  \label{eq:chain}
  \end{align}
  One can construct Classical homological codes by creating a \( \Gamma \) be a connected simplicial graph, not a tree. Check detail here \cite{arXiv:quant-ph/0605094}.

  rate: 'A family of linear codes \(C_i = [n_i,k_i,d_i]\) is \textit{asymptotically good} if the asymptotic rate \(\lim_{i\to\infty} k_i/n_i\) and asymptotic distance \(\lim_{i\to\infty} d_i/n_i\) are both positive.'

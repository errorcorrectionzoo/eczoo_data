logical: galois

name: 'True Galois-qudit stabilizer code'
introduced: '\cite{preset:GottesmanBook}'

description: |
  Also called a \textit{linear stabilizer code}. A \([[n,k,d]]_{GF(q)}\) stabilizer code whose stabilizer's symplectic representation forms a linear subspace. In other words, the set of \(q\)-ary vectors representing the stabilizer group is closed under both addition and multiplication by elements of \(GF(q)\). In contrast, Galois-qudit stabilizer codes admit sets of vectors that are closed under addition only.

  The number of generators \(r\) for a true stabilizer code is a multiple of \(m\) (recall that \(q=p^m\) for Galois qudits). As a result, the number \(k=n-r/m\) of logical qudits is an integer.

  Each code can be represented by a stabilizer generator matrix \(H=(A|B)\), where each row \((a|b)\) is the \(GF(q)\)-valued symplectic representation of a stabilizer generator.

protection: 'Detects errors on up to \(d-1\) qudits, and corrects erasure errors on up to \(d-1\) qudits.'

      detail: 'A true Galois-qudit stabilizer code is the closest quantum analogue of a linear code over \(GF(q)\) because the \(q\)-ary vectors corresponding to the symplectic representation of the stabilizers form a linear subspace.'
  #  - code_id: dual IS THIS TRUE?
  #    detail: 'Symplectic representations of true stabilizer group elements form a linear code over \(GF(q)\). This fact along with the stabilizer commutation requirement implies that the code is self-orthogonal with respect to both the trace-symplectic and Hermitian inner products.'

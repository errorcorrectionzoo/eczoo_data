code_id: two_block_quantum
physical: galois
logical: galois

name: 'Two-block quantum code'
introduced: \cite{arXiv:1212.6703}

alternative_names:
  - 'Two-square-block code'

description: |
  Galois-qudit CSS code whose stabilizer generator matrices \(H_X=(A,B)\) and \(H_Z=(B^T,-A^T)\), are constructed from a pair of square commuting matrices \(A\) and \(B\).

  Generalized constructions utilizing more than two blocks have also been considered \cite{arxiv:2310.15092}.

protection: |
  Code parameters are generally unknown, although they can be formally expressed in terms of ranks of some matrices related to \(A\) and \(B\).  The corresponding expressions, as well as some upper and lower bounds on parameters are given in \cite{arXiv:2306.16400}.

      detail: 'When matrices \(A\) and \(B\) have row and column weights bounded by \(W\), a two-block quantum code is a quantum LDPC code with stabilizer generators bounded by \(2W\).'
    - code_id: lifted_product
      detail: 'LP codes can be constructed using non-square matrices and taking a hypergraph product over a group algebra, while two-block quantum codes are constructed directly using square matrices.'

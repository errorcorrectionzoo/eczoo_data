name: 'Galois-qudit stabilizer code'
introduced: '\cite{doi:10.1109/18.959288,arXiv:quant-ph/0508070}'

description: |
  An \(((n,K,d))_q\) Galois-qudit code whose logical subspace is the joint eigenspace of commuting Galois-qudit Pauli operators forming the code's stabilizer group \(\mathsf{S}\). Traditionally, the logical subspace is the joint \(+1\) eigenspace, and the stabilizer group does not contain \(e^{i \phi} I\) for any \(\phi \neq 0\). The distance \(d\) is the minimum weight of a Galois-qudit Pauli string that implements a nontrivial logical operation in the code.

  A Galois-qudit stabilizer code encoding an integer number of qudits (\(K=q^k\)) is denoted as \([[n,k]]_q\) or \([[n,k,d]]_q\). This notation differentiates between Galois-qudit and modular-qudit \([[n,k,d]]_{\mathbb{Z}_q}\) stabilizer codes, although the same notation is usually used for both. Galois-qudit stabilizer codes need not encode an integer number of qudits, with \(K=q^{n-\frac{r}{m}}\), where \(r\) is the number of generators of the stabilizer group, and \(q=p^m\) given prime \(p\) for all Galois qudits. As a result, \([[n,k,d]]\) notation is often used with non-integer \(k=\log_q K\).

  The stabilizer commutation condition can equivalently be stated in the symplectic representation. A pair of Galois-qudit stabilizers on \(n\) Galois qudits with symplectic representation vectors \((a|b)\) and \((a^{\prime}|b^{\prime})\) commute iff their \textit{trace symplectic inner product} is zero,
  \begin{align}
  \text{tr}(a \cdot b^{\prime} - a^{\prime}\cdot b) = \sum_{j=1}^{n} \text{tr}(a_j b^{\prime}_j - a^{\prime}_i b_i) = 0~.
  \end{align}
  Symplectic representations of stabilizer group elements thus form a self-orthogonal subspace of \(GF(q)^{2n}\) with respect to the trace-symplectic inner product.

  Note that the above trace-symplectic inner product reduces to the \textit{symplectic inner product} when the trace is removed, and a symplectic self-orthogonal set of vectors is automatically trace-symplectic self-orthogonal. More generally, any additive classical code whose self-orthogonality under some inner product (such as Hermitian, Euclidean, or symplectic) implies trace-symplectic self-orthogonality of an equivalent code can be used to construct a Galois-qudit stabilizer code (see children).

#  Each code can be represented by a stabilizer generator matrix \(H=(A|B)\), where each row \((a|b)\) is the \(GF(q)\)-valued symplectic representation of a stabilizer generator. # Leonid comment: "Usually, if the group is additive, we have to list all generators explicitly.  But if it is linear over some field F (subfield of F_q or F_q itself) we may list the generators as would be expected for that group -fewer of them, as the number of generators is the rank of the matrix over that field (or additive rank).  All may have different values.  I think the explicit specification is needed to reduce any confusion."

#         'An \(((n,q^k,d))_q\) stabilizer code is denoted as \([[n,k]]_q\) or \([[n,k,d]]_q\), where \(d\) is the code''s distance and \(q=p^m\).
#The {\(GF(q)\)} stabilizer of \(Q\) is the set \(S(Q) = \{M \in P_n(q)|\, |\psi\rangle\) is a generalized eigenvector of  \(M\) with generalized eigenvalue 0 \(\forall |\psi\rangle \in Q\}  \).
#\(S\) is \(GF(q)\) stabilizer if it is Abelian and if \(e^{i\phi}I \notin S\) for any phase \(\phi \ne 0\).
#The code space of \(GF(q)\) stabilizer \(S\) is the subspace \(\mathcal{T}(S) = \{|\psi \rangle \, \mathrm{s.t.}\, M|\psi\rangle = |\psi \rangle,\, \forall M\in S \}.  \)
#The normalizer \(N(S)\) of the stabilizer \(S\) is \(N(S) = \{ N \in P|NM=MN, \, \forall M\in S\}\).


# Logical subspace is the joint \(+1\) eigenspace of a set of \(p^{n-k}\) commuting qudit Pauli operators forming the code''s stabilizer group, which cannot contain \(-I\). The distance is the minimum weight of an error that implements a nontrivial logical operation in the code.'
# Galois qudit codes have lifted stabiilizers, generally k=n-r/m; see Gottesmna's talk

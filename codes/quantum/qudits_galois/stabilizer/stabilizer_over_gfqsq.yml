description: |
  An \([[n,k,d]]_q\) true Galois-qudit stabilizer code constructed from a Hermitian self-orthogonal linear code over \(\mathbb{F}_{q^2}\) using the one-to-one correspondence between the Galois-qudit Pauli matrices and elements of the Galois field \(\mathbb{F}_{q^2}\).

  Galois-qudit stabilizer codes are in one-to-one correspondence with trace-alternating self-orthogonal additive codes of length \(n\) over \(\mathbb{F}_{q^2}\) via the \hyperref[topic:gfqsq-representation]{\(\mathbb{F}_{q^2}\) representation}.
  Hermitian self-orthogonal linear codes over \(\mathbb{F}_{q^2}\) are automatically trace-alternating self-orthogonal, and applying this mapping to such codes yields Hermitian codes \cite[Corr. 19]{arxiv:quant-ph/0508070}.

protection: |
  A Hermitian self-orthogonal linear \([n,k,d]_{q^2}\) code yields an \([[n,n-2k]]_q\) true stabilizer code with distance no less than \(d\); this is called the \textit{Hermitian construction}.
  The Hermitian construction was first proven via the \hyperref[topic:galois-symplectic-representation]{Galois symplectic representation} (showing self-orthogonality under the trace-symplectic inner product; see Ref. \cite{doi:10.1109/18.959288}, Corr. 1).
  There is an isomorphism between the \hyperref[topic:galois-symplectic-representation]{Galois-symplectic} and \hyperref[topic:gfqsq-representation]{\(\mathbb{F}_{q^2}\) representations} \cite[Thm. 27.3.8]{preset:HKSquantum}.

  It has also been extended to \(q^{2m}\)-ary Hermitian self-orthogonal linear codes \cite{arxiv:2012.11998}, and similar constructions were formulated in Ref. \cite{arxiv:1002.4088}.
  \textit{Quantum construction X}, related to (classical) Construction X and Construction XX, allows for the use of nearly self-orthogonal codes \cite{doi:10.1007/s10623-014-9934-8,manual:{Lisonek, Petr, and Reza Dastbasteh.

#   and later proven via the \hyperref[code:stabilizer_over_gfqsq]{Hermitian construction} (showing self-orthogonality under the trace-alternating inner product; see Ref. \cite[Corr. 19]{arxiv:quant-ph/0508070}, ).

# An \(n\) Galois-qudit Pauli stabilizer can be represented as a length-\(n\) vector over \(\mathbb{F}_{q^2}\). The stabilizer commutation condition corresponds to a zero trace-alternating inner product between the corresponding vectors.

#  The classical code corresponds to the stabilizer group \(\mathsf{S}\) while \(C^{\perp}\) corresponds to the normalizer \(\mathsf{N(S)}\).

# - code_id: dual_additive
#   detail: 'The stabilizer commutation condition for stabilizer codes over \(\mathbb{F}_{q^2}\) can equivalently be stated in the representation of stabilizers as vectors over \(\mathbb{F}_{q^2}\).
#   A pair of \(n\) Galois-qudit stabilizers commute iff the trace-alternating inner product of their their corresponding vectors is zero.
#   Stabilizer codes over \(\mathbb{F}_{q^2}\) can thus be constructed from trace-alternating self-orthogonal additive codes over \(\mathbb{F}_{q^2}\).'

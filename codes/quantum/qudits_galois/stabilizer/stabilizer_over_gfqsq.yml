#   - 'Stabilizer code over \(GF(q^2)\)'

description: |
  An \([[n,k,d]]_q\) true Galois-qudit stabilizer code constructed from a Hermitian self-orthogonal linear code over \(GF(q^2)\) using the one-to-one correspondence between the Galois-qudit Pauli matrices and elements of the Galois field \(GF(q^2)\).

  Galois-qudit stabilizer codes are in one-to-one correspondence with trace-alternating self-orthogonal additive codes of length \(n\) over \(GF(q^2)\) via the \hyperref[topic:gfqsq-representation]{\(GF(q^2)\) representation}.
  Hermitian self-orthogonal linear codes over \(GF(q^2)\) are automatically trace-alternating self-orthogonal, and applying this mapping to such codes yields Hermitian-construction codes \cite[Corr. 19]{arxiv:quant-ph/0508070}.

protection: |
  A Hermitian self-orthogonal linear \([n,k,d]_{q^2}\) code yields an \([[n,n-2k]]_q\) true stabilizer code with distance no less than \(d\); this is called the \textit{Hermitian construction}.

  The Hermitian construction was first proven via the symplectic representation (showing self-orthogonality under the trace-symplectic inner product; see Ref. \cite{doi:10.1109/18.959288}, Corr. 1).
  There is an isomorphism between the symplectic and \(GF(q^2)\) representations \cite[Thm. 27.3.8]{preset:HKSquantum}.

  It has also been extended to \(q^{2m}\)-ary Hermitian self-orthogonal linear codes \cite{arxiv:2012.11998}, and similar constructions were formulated in Ref. \cite{arxiv:1002.4088}.


#   and later proven via the \hyperref[code:stabilizer_over_gfqsq]{Hermitian construction} (showing self-orthogonality under the trace-alternating inner product; see Ref. \cite[Corr. 19]{arxiv:quant-ph/0508070}, ).

# An \(n\) Galois-qudit Pauli stabilizer can be represented as a length-\(n\) vector over \(GF(q^2)\). The stabilizer commutation condition corresponds to a zero trace-alternating inner product between the corresponding vectors.

#  The classical code corresponds to the stabilizer group \(\mathsf{S}\) while \(C^{\perp}\) corresponds to the normalizer \(\mathsf{N(S)}\).

#   detail: 'The stabilizer commutation condition for stabilizer codes over \(GF(q^2)\) can equivalently be stated in the representation of stabilizers as vectors over \(GF(q^2)\).
#   A pair of \(n\) Galois-qudit stabilizers commute iff the trace-alternating inner product of their their corresponding vectors is zero.
#   Stabilizer codes over \(GF(q^2)\) can thus be constructed from trace-alternating self-orthogonal additive codes over \(GF(q^2)\).'

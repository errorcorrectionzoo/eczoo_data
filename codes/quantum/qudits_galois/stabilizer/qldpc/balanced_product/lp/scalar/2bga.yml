  2BGA codes are the smallest \hyperref[code:lifted_product]{LP codes}
  LP\((a,b)\), constructed from a pair of \hyperref[topic:group-algebra]{group algebra} elements
  \(a,b\in \mathbb{F}_q[G]\), where \(G\) is a finite group, and \(\mathbb{F}_q\) is a Galois field.
  For a group of order \(\ell\), we get a 2BGA code of length
  \(n=2\ell\).
  A 2BGA code for an Abelian group is called an \textit{Abelian 2BGA code}.
  A construction of such codes in terms of Kronecker products of circulant matrices was introduced in \cite{arxiv:1212.6703}.

  An \(\mathbb{F}_q\)-linear code isomorphic to a \(Z\) logical subspace of the 2BGA code LP\((a,b)\) can be most
  naturally defined as a linear space of pairs
  \((u,v)\in \mathbb{F}_q[G]\times \mathbb{F}_q[G]\) such that
  \begin{align}
    a u+v b=0,
  \end{align}
  with any two pairs \((u,v)\) and \((u',v')\) such that \(u'=u+w b\)
  and \(v'=v-aw\) considered equivalent.
  The order in the products is relevant when the group is non-Abelian.

  For example, consider the
  alternating group \(G=A_4=T\), also known as the rotation group of a
  regular tetrahedron,
  \begin{align}
    T=\langle x,y|x^3=(yx)^3=y^2=1\rangle,\quad |T|=12,
  \end{align} and the
  binary algebra \(\mathbb{F}_2[T]\).  Select \(a=1+x+y+x^{-1}yx\)
  and \(b=1+x+y+yx\) to get an \emph{essentially non-Abelian} 2BGA code
  LP\([a,b]\) with parameters \([[24,5,3]]\) \cite{arxiv:2306.16400}.

# \subsection{Examples}
#
# 1. GB codes: For the cyclic group \(\mathbb{Z}_{\ell}\equiv \langle x|x^\ell=1\rangle \),
# any element \(a\) of the \hyperref[topic:group-algebra]{group algebra} \(\mathbb{F}_q[\mathbb{Z}_{\ell}]\) can be seen as a
# polynomial \(a(x)\in \mathbb{F}_q[x]\) over the group generator \(x\), where the
# polynomial degree deg\(a(x)<\ell\).  The 2BGA code LP\((a,b)\) is just
# a generalized bicycle code GB\([a(x),b(x)]\) constructed from the
# polynomials \(a(x)\) and \(b(x)\) corresponding to
# \(a,b\in \mathbb{F}_q[\mathbb{Z}_{\ell}]\).
#
# 2. Multi-dimensional quantum quasi-cyclic codes: Any finite Abelian
# group can be written as a direct product of several cyclic groups,
# e.g., \(G=C_{m_1}\times C_{m_2}\times \ldots C_{m_D}\) for a product
# of \(D\) cyclic groups, which is equivalent to a representation
# \begin{align}
#   G=\langle x_1,\ldots,x_D|x_1^{m_1}=x_2^{m_2}=\ldots=x_D^{m_D}\rangle.
# \end{align}
# Respectively, an element of the \hyperref[topic:group-algebra]{group algebra} \(\mathbb{F}_q[G]\), where \(\mathbb{F}_q\) is
# a finite field, can be written as a \(D\)-variate polynomial in
# \(\mathbb{F}_q[x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_D]\), with the degree of the generator \(x_j\) of
# order \(m_j\) not exceeding \(m_j-1\).  Thus, any Abelian 2BGA code
# can be thought of as a multi-dimensional index-two quasi-cyclic code.
# This includes toric codes and Haah's cubic codes.  An equivalent
# construction in terms of Kronecker products of circulant matrices was
# introduced in \cite{arxiv:1212.6703}.
# Related higher-dimensional
# quasi-cyclic and convolutional quantum codes have been constructed in
# \cite{arxiv:2305.00137}.
#
# 3. Several Abelian 2BGA codes with stabilizer generators of weight 6
# have been constructed by Bravyi et al. \cite{arxiv:2308.07915}.  These
# are two-dimensional QC codes which admit time-optimal syndrome
# measurement circuits which can be implemented in a two-layer
# architecture, a generalization of the square-lattice architecture
# optimal for the surface codes.  Circuit simulations show a threshold
# of approximately \(0.8\%\).
#
# 4. Explicit example from \cite{arxiv:2306.16400}: Consider the
# alternating group \(A_4\), also known as the rotation group of a
# regular tetrahedron,
# \begin{align}
#   T=\langle x,y|x^3=(yx)^3=y^2=1\rangle,\quad |T|=12,
# \end{align} and the
# binary algebra \(\mathbb{F}_q_2[T]\).  Select \(a=1+x+y+x^{-1}yx\)
# and \(b=1+x+y+yx\) to get an \emph{essentially non-Abelian} 2BGA code
# LP\([a,b]\) with parameters \([[24,5,3]]_2\) \cite{arxiv:2306.16400}.

  Some upper and lower bounds on parameters and many examples of 2BGA codes are given in Ref. \cite{arxiv:2306.16400}.
  The code dimension \(k\) for Abelian 2BGA codes is always even \cite{manual:{Kalachev, G. V., and Panteleev, P. A. (2020). On the minimum distance in one class of quantum LDPC codes. Intelligent systems. Theory and applications, 24(4), 87-117.}}.

    The 2BGA construction gives some of the best short codes with small stabilizer weights.

    A number of 2BGA codes \([[n,k,d]]_q\) with row weights
    \(W\le 8\), block lengths \(n\le 100\), and parameters such that
    \(kd\ge n\) have been constructed by
    exhaustive enumeration \cite{arxiv:2306.16400}.  Examples include GB codes with parameters
    \([[70,8,10]]\), \([[72,10,9]]\), Abelian 2BGA for groups
    \(\mathbb{Z}_{mh}=\mathbb{Z}_m\times \mathbb{Z}_2\) (index-4 QC codes) with parameters
    \([[48,8,6]]\) and \([[56,8,7]]\), and non-Abelian codes with
    parameters \([[64,8,8]]\), \([[82,10,9]]\), \([[96,10,12]]\),
    and \([[96,12,10]]\) (all of these have stabilizer generators of
    weight \(W=8\).)


notes:

Hastings, LR codes, private communication, 2014.}}; see Ref. \cite{arxiv:1812.02101}, which contains an error in Prop. 3.2 \cite{manual:{Hsiang-Ku Lin and Leonid Pryadko, private communication, 2024.}}.'

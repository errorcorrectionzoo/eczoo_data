description: |
  Galois-qudit code that utilizes the notion of a lifted product in its construction. Lifted products of certain classical Tanner codes are the first (asymptotically) \textit{good QLDPC codes}.

  A code can be defined by \(LP(A,B)\), where \(A\) and \(B\) are a pair of matrices with elements from a \hyperref[topic:group-algebra]{group algebra}.
  Heuristically, the code is constructed as a hypergraph product code over the \hyperref[topic:group-algebra]{group algebra}, with each entry subsequently extended into a matrix.

  More technically, a \textit{lifted product over} a ring \(R\) is a product of two chain complexes whose chains are free modules over \(R\).
  An interesting case is when \(R=\mathbb{F}_q [G]\), the \hyperref[topic:group-algebra]{group-\(G\) algebra} over the finite field \({\mathbb{F}}_q = \mathbb{F}_q\); in this case, the product can be called a \(G\)-\textit{lifted product}.
  Just like its further generalization the balanced product, a lifted product code generalizes a hypergraph product code in that a reduction of symmetry is exploited to decrease the number of physical qubits required.

  The key operation behind the \(G\)-lifted product is the \(G\)-\textit{lift}, a \hyperref[topic:group-algebra]{group-algebraic} version of the \hyperref[topic:lifting]{lifting} procedure of protograph LDPC codes.
  A combination of the lift and the usual hypergraph product yields lifted-product codes.
  The two operations commute: one can first take the usual hypergraph product of two chain complexes, and then lift the resulting product complex; equivalently, one can take the hypergraph product of the two lifted complexes.

      detail: 'Coarsely speaking, a lifted product is a balanced product where the group \(G\) acts freely. In principle, a lifted product can be defined for rings that are more general than \hyperref[topic:group-algebra]{group algebras} \( \mathbb{F}_q G \).'

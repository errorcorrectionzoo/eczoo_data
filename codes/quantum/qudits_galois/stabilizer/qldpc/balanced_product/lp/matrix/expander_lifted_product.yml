name: 'Expander LP code'
introduced: '\cite{arxiv:2111.03654}'

description: |
  Family of \(G\)-lifted product codes constructed using two random classical \hyperref[code:tanner]{Tanner codes} defined on expander graphs \cite{doi:10.1090/S0273-0979-06-01126-8}. For certain parameters, this construction yields the first asymptotically good QLDPC codes. Classical codes resulting from this construction are one of the first two families of \(c^3\)-LTCs.

  An expander lifted-product code family is constructed as follows. First, take the Cayley graph of a finite group \(G\).
  Second, take the double cover of the graph, resulting in a graph that satisfies the requirements of participating in a \(G\)-lifted product (i.e., the resulting graph is a free \({\mathbb{F}}_q G\)-module). Third, create a \hyperref[code:tanner]{Tanner code} out of the graph, in which parity-check supports are defined by the graph, and bitstrings satisfying a particular parity check are defined to be the codewords of a small classical code (chosen to be a random code in the construction). Fourth, take the \(G\)-lifted product of two copies of the \hyperref[code:tanner]{Tanner code}.

  The small classical codes used in the construction of good QLDPC codes are required to have a certain product-expansion property (Lemma 10 in Ref. \cite{arxiv:2111.03654}); it is proven that random codes satisfy said property in the thermodynamic limit.

protection: 'Code performance strongly depends on \(G\). Certain non-Abelian groups yield asymptotically good QLDPC codes with parameters \([[n, k = \Theta(n), d = \Theta(n)]]\) \cite{arxiv:2111.03654}. Abelian groups like \(\mathbb{Z}_{\ell}\) for \(\ell=\Theta(n / \log n)\) yield constant-rate codes with parameters \([[n, k = \Theta(n), d = \Theta(n / \log n)]]\) \cite{arxiv:2012.04068}; this construction can be derandomized by being reformulated as a balanced product code \cite{arxiv:2012.09271}.'

features:
  rate: 'Expander lifted-product codes for non-Abelian groups include the first examples \cite{arxiv:2111.03654} of (asymptotically) \textit{good QLDPC codes}, i.e., codes with asymptotically constant rate and linear distance. Expander LP codes for Abelian groups like \(\mathbb{Z}_{\ell}\) for \(\ell=\Theta(n / \log n)\) yield constant-rate codes with parameters \([[n, k = \Theta(n), d = \Theta(n / \log n)]]\) \cite{arxiv:2012.04068}; this construction can be derandomized by being reformulated as a balanced product code \cite{arxiv:2012.09271}.Other explicit versions of codes with such parameters have been developed \cite{arxiv:2112.01647}.'

      detail: 'Expander lifted-product codes are quantum CSS codes that utilize short classical codes in their construction which need to satisfy some properties (Ref. \cite{arxiv:2111.03654}, Lemma 10). It is shown that such codes exist, but they are not explicitly constructed. Such codes can be obtained by repeated random sampling or by performing a search of all codes of desired length. Nevertheless, since the length of the desired short codes does not scale with \(n\), this construction is effectively explicit.'

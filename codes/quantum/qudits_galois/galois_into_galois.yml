name: 'Galois-qudit code'
introduced: '\cite{doi:10.1002/(SICI)1520-6610(2000)8:3<174::AID-JCD3>3.0.CO;2-T,arXiv:quant-ph/0508070}'

description: 'Also called a \(GF(q)\)\textit{-} or \(\mathbb{F}_q\)\textit{-qudit code}. Encodes \(K\)-dimensional Hilbert space into a \(q^n\)-dimensional (\(n\)-qudit) Hilbert space, with canonical qudit states \(|k\rangle\) labeled by elements \(k\) of the \textit{Galois field} \(GF(q)\) and with \(q\) being a power of a prime \(p\). A Galois field can be thought of as a vector space whose basis vectors are the \(m\) roots of some polynomial and whose coefficients (i.e., field) are \(p\)th roots of unity. Codes can be denoted as \(((n,K))_{GF(q)}\) or \(((n,K,d))_{GF(q)}\), whenever the code''s distance \(d\) is defined. This notation differentiates between Galois-qudit and modular-qudit codes, although the same notation, \(((n,K,d))_q\), is usually used for both.'

features:
  decoders:
    - 'For few-qudit codes (\(n\) is small), decoding can be based on a lookup table. For infinite code families, the size of such a table scales exponentially with \(n\), so approximate decoding algorithms scaling polynomially with \(n\) have to be used. The decoder determining the most likely error given a noise channel is called the \textit{maximum-likelihood decoder}.'

      detail: 'A Galois qudit for \(q=p^m\) can be decomposed into a Kronecker product of \(m\) modular qudits \cite{arXiv:quant-ph/0005008}; see Sec. 5.3 of Ref. \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/0501074}. The two coincide when \(q\) is prime, and reduce to qubits when \(q=2\). However, Pauli matrices for the two types of qudits are defined differently.'

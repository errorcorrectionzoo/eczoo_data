name: 'Galois-qudit code'
introduced: '\cite{doi:10.1002/(SICI)1520-6610(2000)8:3<174::AID-JCD3>3.0.CO;2-T}'

description: 'Encodes \(K\)-dimensional Hilbert space into a \(q^n\)-dimensional (\(n\)-qudit) Hilbert space, with canonical qudit states \(|k\rangle\) labeled by elements \(k\) of the \textit{Galois field} \(GF(q)\) and with \(q\) being a power of a prime \(p\). A Galois field can be thought of as a vector space whose basis vectors are the \(m\) roots of some polynomial and whose coefficients (i.e., field) are \(p\)th roots of unity. Codes can be denoted as \(((n,K))_{GF(q)}\) or \(((n,K,d))_{GF(q)}\), whenever the code''s distance \(d\) is defined.'

      detail: 'A Galois qudit for \(q=p^m\) can be decomposed into a Kronecker product of \(m\) \(\mathbb{Z}_q\)-qudits. The two coincide when \(q\) is prime. However, Pauli matrices for the two types of qudits are defined differently.'

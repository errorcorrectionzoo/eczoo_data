name: 'Galois-qudit stabilizer code'
introduced: '\cite{arXiv:quant-ph/0005008,arXiv:quant-ph/0508070}'

description: |
  An \(((n,K,d))_{GF(q)}\) Galois-qudit code whose logical subspace is the joint \(+1\) eigenspace of a set of \(|{\mathsf{S}}|\) commuting Galois-qudit Pauli operators forming the code's stabilizer group \(\mathsf{S}\), which cannot contain \(e^{i\phi}I\) for any \(\phi \neq 0\). The distance \(d\) is the minimum weight of a Galois-qudit Pauli string that implements a nontrivial logical operation in the code.

  A Galois-qudit stabilizer code encoding an integer number of qudits (\(K=q^k\)) is denoted as \([[n,k]]_{GF(q)}\) or \([[n,k,d]]_{GF(q)}\). This notation differentiates between Galois-qudit and modular-qudit stabilizer codes, although the same notation, \([[n,k,d]]_q\), is usually used for both. Galois-qudit stabilizer codes need not encode an integer number of qudits, with \(K=q^{n-\frac{r}{m}}\), where \(r\) is the number of generators of the stabilizer group, and \(q=p^m\) given prime \(p\) for all Galois qudits. As a result, \([[n,k,d]]\) notation is often used with non-integer \(k=\log_q K\).

#  Each code can be represented by a stabilizer generator matrix \(H=(A|B)\), where each row \((a|b)\) is the \(GF(q)\)-valued symplectic representation of a stabilizer generator. # Leonid comment: "Usually, if the group is additive, we have to list all generators explicitly.  But if it is linear over some field F (subfield of F_q or F_q itself) we may list the generators as would be expected for that group -fewer of them, as the number of generators is the rank of the matrix over that field (or additive rank).  All may have different values.  I think the explicit specification is needed to reduce any confusion."

#         'An \(((n,q^k,d))_{GF(q)}\) stabilizer code is denoted as \([[n,k]]_{GF(q)}\) or \([[n,k,d]]_{GF(q)}\), where \(d\) is the code''s distance and \(q=p^m\).
#The {\(GF(q)\)} stabilizer of \(Q\) is the set \(S(Q) = \{M \in P_n(q)|\, |\psi\rangle\) is a generalized eigenvector of  \(M\) with generalized eigenvalue 0 \(\forall |\psi\rangle \in Q\}  \).
#\(S\) is \(GF(q)\) stabilizer if it is Abelian and if \(e^{i\phi}I \notin S\) for any phase \(\phi \ne 0\).
#The code space of \(GF(q)\) stabilizer \(S\) is the subspace \(\mathcal{T}(S) = \{|\psi \rangle \, \mathrm{s.t.}\, M|\psi\rangle = |\psi \rangle,\, \forall M\in S \}.  \)
#The normalizer \(N(S)\) of the stabilizer \(S\) is \(N(S) = \{ N \in P|NM=MN, \, \forall M\in S\}\).


# Logical subspace is the joint \(+1\) eigenspace of a set of \(p^{n-k}\) commuting qudit Pauli operators forming the code''s stabilizer group, which cannot contain \(-I\). The distance is the minimum weight of an error that implements a nontrivial logical operation in the code.'
# Galois qudit codes have lifted stabiilizers, generally k=n-r/m; see Gottesmna's talk

    - 'As opposed to modular qudits for composite \(q\), Galois qudits inherit most of the properties of the prime-qudit Clifford group due to the correspondence between a \(q=p^m\) Galois qudit and \(m\) prime qudits of dimension \(p\) \cite{arXiv:quant-ph/0005008}.'

      detail: 'Recalling that \(q=p^m\), Galois-qudit stabilizer codes can also be treated as prime-qudit stabilizer codes on \(mn\) qudits, giving \(k=nm-r\) \cite{arXiv:quant-ph/0005008}. The case \(m=1\) reduces to conventional prime-qudit stabilizer codes on \(n\) qudits.'

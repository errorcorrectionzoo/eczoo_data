# Following Gottesman's book, but removed finite dims
description: |
  Encodes quantum information in a (\textit{logical}) subspace of a
  (\textit{physical}) Hilbert space such that it is possible to recover said
  information from errors that act as linear maps on the physical space.

  Since quantum information is encoded in quantum superpositions, an additional source of noise (not relevant to classical encodings) can affect the relative phase of such superpositions.
  Quantum error-correcting codes have to protect against such \textit{phase-flip noise} while also protecting against conventional classical \textit{bit-flip} noise.
  Codes are not expected to protect against both types of noise perfectly, and there is generally a tradeoff.

  The
  logical subspace is spanned by a basis comprised of \textit{code basis states}
  or \textit{codewords}. Codewords may not be normalizable if the physical
  Hilbert space in infinite, so approximate versions have to be constructed in
  practice.

protection: |
  Denoting Hilbert spaces by the letter \(\mathsf{H}\), a quantum code
  \((U,\cal{E})\) is a partial isometry
  \(U:\mathsf{H}_{\text{logical}}\to\mathsf{H}_{\text{physical}}\) with a set of
  correctable errors \(\cal{E}\) with the following property: there exists a
  quantum operation \(\cal{D}\) such that for all \(E\in\cal{E}\) and states
  \(|\psi\rangle\in\mathsf{H}_{\text{logical}}\),
  \begin{align}
    {\cal D} (EU|\psi\rangle\langle\psi|U^{\dagger}E^{\dagger})
    = c(E,|\psi\rangle)|\psi\rangle\langle\psi|
  \end{align}
  for some constant \(c\).

  Equivalently, correction capability is determined by the \term{Knill-Laflamme conditions}, which may admit infinite terms due to non-normalizability of ideal code states in the case of codes with infinite-dimenional physical spaces. A code that satisfies these conditions approximately, i.e., up to some small quantifiable error, is called an \hyperref[code:approximate_qecc]{approximate code}. These conditions can also be formulated in terms of a dual Heisenberg picture, where correctability is checked for some algebra of observables \cite{arxiv:0811.0421}.

      detail: 'Metrological codes are logical-qubit codes that satisfy the \term{Knill-Laflamme conditions} conditions only partially, and codes that satisfy them fully are QECCs.'

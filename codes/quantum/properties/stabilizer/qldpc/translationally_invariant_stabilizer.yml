code_id: translationally_invariant_stabilizer
# includes both Galois and modular

name: 'Translationally invariant stabilizer code'
introduced: '\cite{arXiv:1101.1962,arXiv:1204.1063,doi:10.7907/GCYW-ZE58}'

description: |
  A geometrically local qubit, modular-qudit, or Galois-qudit stabilizer code with qudits organized on a lattice modeled by the additive group \(\mathbb{Z}^D\) for spatial dimension \(D\) such that each lattice point, referred to as a site,
  contains \(m\) qudits of dimension \(q\).
  The stabilizer group of the translationally invariant code is generated by site-local Pauli operators and their translations.
  Boundary conditions have to be imposed on the lattice in order to obtain finite-dimensional codes.
  Infinite dimensional formulations are also possible, with the 1D lattice version reducing to quantum convolutional codes.

  \begin{defterm}{Pauli-to-polynomial mapping}
  \label{topic:quantum-polynomial-mapping}
  A single-qudit Pauli operator can be specified by the lattice coordinate of the site and the symplectic vector
  representation of the Pauli operator within the site.
  In an extension of the sympletic representation, each lattice coordinate can be represented by a Laurent monomial of \(D\) formal variables. For example, when \(D=2\) and \(m=1\), the product of an \(X\) acting on the qubit at lattice coordinate \((-1,2)\) and a \(Z\) acting on the qubit at \((1,0)\) can be represented by the vector \( (x^{-1} y^2 | x) \). The multiplicative group of finitely supported Pauli operators modulo phase factors on the lattice of dimension \(D\) with \(m\) prime-dimensional qubits per site is isomorphic to the additive group of Laurent polynomial column vectors of length \(2m\) in \(D\) formal variables (see Ref. \cite{arXiv:1607.01387} and Sec. IV of Ref. \cite{arXiv:1812.01625}).
  \end{defterm}

  Translationally-invariant prime-qudit (\(q=p\)) stabilizer codes have been classified in dimensions \(D\in\{1,2\}\), up to equivalence under local constant-depth Clifford circuits. Any 1D (2D) code can be converted to several copies of the 1D repetition code (prime-qudit 2D surface code) along with some trivial codes \cite{arXiv:1607.01387} (\cite{arXiv:1812.11193}). Three-dimensional qubit codes can be characterized by four
  coarse classes \cite{arXiv:1908.08049}:

  1. \textit{Abelian topological phase}: Excitations are mobile in all 3 dimensions, as is typical in a topological code. Such codes are conjectured to be equivalent to a \(\mathbb{Z}_2\) gauge theory, i.e., multiple copies of the 3D surface code or its variant where the charge excitation is a fermion.

  2. \textit{Foliated type-I fracton phase}: Excitations are mobile in less than 3 dimensions, but codes can be grown by \textit{foliation}, i.e., stacking copies of the 2D surface code.

  3. \textit{Fractal type-I fracton phase}: Excitations are mobile in less than 3 dimensions, and codes are not foliated.

  4. \textit{Type-II fracton phase}: Excitations are not mobile in any dimension and there are no string operators.

#The code is specified by a stabilizer group that is generated by site-local Pauli operators and is translationally invariant with respect to the lattice.
#As an example with \(p = 2\) and \(D = 3\), \(P(1, 2, 3; e_1)P(-1, 2, 4; e_{q+2})\) is the Pauli operator that applies \(X\) to
#  qubit \(1\) of lattice point \((1, 2, 3)\) and applies \(Z\) to qubit \(2\) of lattice point \((-1, 2, 4)\). This operator can be
#  equivalently expressed by the Laurent polynomial \(x_1x_2^2x_3^3e_1 + x_1^{-1}x_2^2x_3^4e_{q+2}\).

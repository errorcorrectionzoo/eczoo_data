name: 'Stabilizer code'

description: |
  A code whose logical subspace is the joint eigenspace (usually with eigenvalue \(+1\)) of a set of commuting unitary operators forming the code's stabilizer group.
  They can be block codes defined of tensor-product spaces of qubits or qudits, or non-block codes defined on single sufficiently large Hilbert spaces such as bosonic modes or group spaces.

  The coding theory motivation for stabilizer codes came from linear binary codes, whose codewords form a closed subspace in the space of binary strings.
  Stabilizer codes extend this property, in various ways, to quantum error correction.
  The stabilizer formalism is applicable to almost all quantum-code kingdoms; see \href{https://errorcorrectionzoo.org/list/stabilizer}{list of stabilizer codes} for a list of all stabilizer codes in the zoo.

  Stabilizer codes were originally defined for qubits, where the relevant commuting operators are tensor products of Pauli matrices.
  The Pauli stabilizer structure is useful in providing standardized encoding, gates, decoding, and performance bounds.
  Elements of this structure remain in qudit extensions, in particular for prime-dimensional modular qudits and Galois qudits.
  Other qubit-based extensions, such as \hyperref[code:xs_stabilizer]{XS} and \hyperref[code:xp_stabilizer]{XP} stabilizer codes, relax the mutual commutation property.
  Still other extensions defined for Galois qudits include \hyperref[code:non_stabilizer]{non-stabilizer codes}.

#  Stabilizer codes have been defined for qubits, modular qudits, Galois qudits, and oscillators using their respective Pauli-type groups.
# An important property of qubit and qudit stabilizer codes is the QLDPC property, which means (roughly) that working with them remains not too hard as number of qudits grows; these remain as the primary ingredients for a quantum memory.

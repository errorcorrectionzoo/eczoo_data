# includes Galois, modular, oscillators, and groups

name: 'Stabilizer code'

description: |
  A code whose logical subspace is the joint eigenspace (usually with eigenvalue \(+1\)) of a set of commuting unitary Pauli-type operators forming the code's stabilizer group.
  They can be block codes defined of tensor-product spaces of qubits or qudits, or non-block codes defined on single sufficiently large Hilbert spaces such as bosonic modes or group spaces.

  The coding theory motivation for stabilizer codes came from linear binary codes, whose codewords form a closed subspace in the space of binary strings.
  Stabilizer codes extend this property, in various ways, to quantum error correction.
  Stabilizer codes can be defined succinctly using the stabilizer group generators and without explicitly writing out a basis of codewords.
  The stabilizer formalism is applicable to almost all quantum-code kingdoms; see \href{https://errorcorrectionzoo.org/list/stabilizer}{list of stabilizer codes} for a list of all stabilizer codes.

  Stabilizer codes were originally defined for qubits, where the relevant commuting operators are tensor products of Pauli matrices.
  The Pauli stabilizer structure is useful in providing standardized encoding, gates, decoding, and performance bounds.
  Elements of this structure remain in qudit extensions, in particular for prime-dimensional modular qudits and Galois qudits.
  Infinite-dimensional Pauli-type bases yield the bosonic stabilizer and rotor stabilizer codes.

  Extensions of the stabilizer formalism, such as \hyperref[code:xs_stabilizer]{XS} and \hyperref[code:xp_stabilizer]{XP} stabilizer codes, relax the mutual commutation property.
  Other extensions, such as \hyperref[code:cws]{CWS} and \hyperref[code:non_stabilizer]{union stabilizer} codes, enlarge the codespace by re-assigning error words as codewords.

#  Stabilizer codes have been defined for qubits, modular qudits, Galois qudits, and oscillators using their respective Pauli-type groups.
# An important property of qubit and qudit stabilizer codes is the QLDPC property, which means (roughly) that working with them remains not too hard as number of qudits grows; these remain as the primary ingredients for a quantum memory.

  The group of all Pauli-type operators typically serves as the set of noise operators for stabilizer codes.

  general_gates:
    - 'The stabilizer formalism and Gottesman-Knill theorem have been extended to qubits, modular qudits, Galois qudits, and rotors \cite{arxiv:1210.3637,arxiv:1409.4800}.'


features:
  decoders:
    - 'The structure of stabilizer codes allows for straightforward syndrome-based decoding because the stabilizer generators serve as the code''s check operators, and their eigenvalues serve as the error syndromes. The error correction process involves measuring the stabilizer generators and applying correcting Pauli-type operators based on the measurement outcomes.'

#   Stabilizer codes are group-representation codes since their projections are onto an irrep of the logical group formed by those unitary operators that preserve the code (e.g., logical Paulis in the case of qubit stabilizer codes) \cite{arxiv:2306.11621}

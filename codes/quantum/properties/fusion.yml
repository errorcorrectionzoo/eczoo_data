code_id: fusion
physical: qubits
logical: qubits

name: 'Fusion-based quantum computing (FBQC) code'
short_name: 'FBQC'
introduced: '\cite{arXiv:2101.09310}'

description: 'Fusion Based Quantum Computing, or FBQC, describes a fault tolerant way to produce \textit{fusion networks}, or large entangled states starting from small constant-sized entangled resource states along with destructive measurements called \textit{fusions}. These large states can be produced asychronously in the fusion framework and can be used as resources, as in measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC), or as logical states of topological codes. The difference from ordinary MBQC is that error-correction is baked into the state-generation protocol.'

protection: 'Protects against erasure, Pauli errors, photon loss, fusion failure from non-determinism, and faulty resource states.
   Redundancy in fusion outcomes is captured by the check operator group.
   Fusion measurement outcomes form a syndrome that allows to correct for Pauli errors.
   There is no physical error correction, and decoding output is simply used to update the Pauli frame.'

features:
  encoders:
    - 'Resource state generators, which produce small constant size cluster states, and Fusion measurements (Bell fusions).'

  general_gates:
    - 'Clifford gates by creating topological features such as boundaries, defects, or twists, which can be done by single qubit measurements.'
    - 'Logical gates can be performed by code deformation.'
    - 'Non Clifford gates by Magic-state injection'
    - 'Logical Clifford operations can be kept track of using the classical Pauli-frame register and need not be explicitly applied at the quantum level.'

#  decoders:
#    - 'Logical timescales are separated from the physical measurement timescales.'
#    - 'Decoding syndrome information is tracked in the Pauli frame.'

  fault_tolerance:
    - 'Fusion networks are constructed in a fault tolerant way (as a stabilizer code), and they can be created in a way that naturally encodes topological fault tolerance.'

  threshold:
    - '\(11.98\%\) against erasure in fusion measurements.'
    - '\(1.07\%\) against Pauli error.'
    - 'In linear optical systems, can tolerate \(10.4\%\) probability of photon loss in each fusion.'
    - '\(43.2\%\) against fusion failure.'

relations:
  parents:
    - code_id: qubit_stabilizer
      detail: 'The resource states in FBQC are small stabilizer states, and after fusion measurements, the outputs are stabilizers (conditioned on measurement outcomes.'

  cousins:
    - code_id: topological
      detail: 'Arbitrary topological codes can be created using FBQC, as can topological features such as defects and boundaries, by modifying fusion measurements or adding single qubit measurements.'
    - code_id: fock_state
      detail: 'While FBQC is a general framework, an intended application to linear-optical quantum computing will likely utilize small Fock-state bosonic codes such as the dual-rail code.'

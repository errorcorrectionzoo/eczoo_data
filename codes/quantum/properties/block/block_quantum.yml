code_id: block_quantum

name: 'Block quantum code'

description: |
  A code constructed in a multi-partite quantum system, i.e., a physical space consisting of a tensor product of \(n > 1\) identical factors called \textit{subsystems}, \textit{parties}, or \textit{bodies}.
  The subsystems include qubits, modular qudits, Galois qudits, oscillators, or more general groups.
  For finite dimensional codes, the dimension of the underlying subsystem is denoted by \(q\) and is sometimes called the \textit{local dimension}.

  While codewords \(c\) of block codes are elements of \(\Sigma^n\) for some alphabet \(\Sigma\), quantum states of block quantum codes are functions on said alphabet.
  Put differently, the configuration space of the canonical (a.k.a. computational) basis states \(|c\rangle\) of an \(n\)-body quantum system is the classical \(n\)-coordinate alphabet \(\Sigma^n\).
  The table below lists the most common alphabets used in block quantum codes, along with names of the corresponding subsystems.
    \begin{table}
      \begin{cells}
      \celldata<c H, c H>{alphabet \(\Sigma\) & subsystem}
      \celldata<c, c>{
      \(\mathbb{Z}_{2}=GF(2)\) & qubit
          \\
      \(GF(q)\) & Galois qudit
          \\
      \(\mathbb{Z}_{q}\) & modular qudit
          \\
      \(\mathbb{R}\) & bosonic mode
          \\
      \(G\) & group-valued qudit
          \\
      \(\mathcal{C}\) & category-valued qudit
      }
      \end{cells}
      \caption{Table listing the most common alphabets (a.k.a. configuration spaces) used in block quantum codes. Here, \(GF(q)\) is a \hyperref[topic:finite-fields]{finite field}, \(G\) is a finite or infinite group, and \(\mathcal{C}\) is a category.}

protection: |
  Block codes protect from erasures or, more generally, errors acting on a few of the \(n\) subsystems. A block code with \textit{distance} \(d\) detects errors acting on up to \(d-1\) subsystems, and corrects erasure errors on up to \(d-1\) subsystems.

  The \textit{weight} of an operator on a tensor-product Hilbert space is the number of subsystems on which the operator acts non-trivially.
  For example, an operator acting on two subsystem is called a weight-two operator or a two-body operator.

  General noise models for block codes include \textit{stochastic noise}, in which every possible error is assigned a probability.
  In the case of \textit{local stochastic noise}, the probability decreases rapidly (typically, exponentially) with the number of subsystems that an error acts on.
  On the other hand, the \textit{adversarial noise} model consists of errors acting on at most a fixed number of subsystems.
  Errors acting on subsystems in a geometrically local region are called \textit{burst errors} \cite{doi:10.1143/jpsj.69.3540,doi:10.1109/18.771250}.

  \subsection{Bounds on code parameters}
  Bounds on finite dimensional block code performance include the quantum Singleton bound, quantum Hamming bound, \hyperref[topic:quantum-gv-bound]{quantum GV bound}, various quantum linear programming (LP) bounds \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/9611001,arxiv:quant-ph/9709049} (see the book \cite{preset:GottesmanBook}), and other bounds \cite{doi:10.1109/TIT.2005.862086,arxiv:1007.3655}.
  A code whose parameters attain the quantum Hamming bound (quantum Singleton bound) is called a perfect quantum code (a quantum MDS code).
  We are often interested in how parameters of particular infinite block quanutm code families scale with increasing block length \(n\), necessitating the use of \hyperref[topic:asymptotics]{asymptotic notation}.

  \begin{defterm}{Quantum GV bound}
  \label{topic:quantum-gv-bound}
  The \hyperref[topic:quantum-gv-bound]{quantum GV bound} \cite{doi:10.1109/TIT.2004.838088} (see also Refs. \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/9602022,arxiv:quant-ph/9906131,doi:10.1109/18.959288,doi:10.1016/j.jmaa.2007.08.023}) for Galois qudits states that a \hyperref[topic:quantum-weight-enumerator]{pure} \([[n,k,d]]_q\) Galois-qudit stabilizer code exists if 
  \begin{align}
    \frac{q^{n-k+2}-1}{q^{2}-1}>\sum_{j=1}^{d-1}(q^{2}-1)^{j-1}\binom{n}{j}~.
  \end{align}
  The quantum GV bound gives rise to the \textit{asymptotic quantum GV bound} (i.e., quantum GV bound in the \(n\to\infty\) limit), expressed in terms of the maximum achievable rate \(R\) and relative distance \(\delta\),
  \begin{align}
    R\geq 1-\delta\log_q(q+1) - h_{q}(\delta)~,
  \end{align}
  where \(h_q\) is the \hyperref[topic:gv-bound]{\(q\)-ary entropy function}.
  \end{defterm}

# Many of the above bounds are independent of construction so have to go into block quantum.

    - '\begin{defterm}{Eastin-Knill theorem}
      \label{topic:eastin-knill}
      \textit{Transversal gates} are logical gates on block codes that can be realized as tensor products of unitary operations acting on subsets of subsystems whose size is independent of \(n\).
      For subsets of size one, gates are sometimes called \textit{strongly transversal} the single-subsystem unitaries are identical and \textit{weakly transversal} otherwise.
      A universal gate set for a finite-dimensional block quantum code cannot be transversal for any code that detects single-block errors due to the Eastin-Knill theorem \cite{arxiv:0811.4262}.

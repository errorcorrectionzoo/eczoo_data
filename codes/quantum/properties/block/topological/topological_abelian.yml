code_id: topological_abelian

name: 'Abelian topological code'
#introduced: ''

description: |
  Code whose codewords realize topological order associated with an Abelian anyon theory.
  In 2D, this is equivalent to a unitary braided fusion category which is also an Abelian group under fusion \cite{arxiv:2004.12048}.
  Unless otherwise noted, the phases discussed are bosonic.

  \subsection{2D Abelian topological codes}

  A theory is defined by an Abelian group \(A\) of anyon types whose multiplication relations define the fusion rules, and a set of exchange statistics \(\theta(a)\in U(1)\) obtained by exchanging two anyons of type \(a\in A\).
  The exchange statistics in turn define braiding relations,
  \begin{align}
    B(a,b) = \frac{\theta(ab)}{\theta(a)\theta(b)}~,
  \end{align}
  between all anyon pairs \(a,b\).

  All 2D Abelian bosonic topological orders can be understood within the subsystem stabilizer formalism \cite{arxiv:2211.03798}.
  As such, many of the operations one can perform on such codes have both a stabilizer and a topological-phase interpretation.
  Stabilizer generators of 2D topological codes acting on 1D loops of qubits can be interpreted as one-form symmetries of the underlying phase realized by the code.
  Identification of an anyon \(a\) with the vacuum is equivalent to adding string excitation operators corresponding to \(a\) to the stabilizer group and taking the center to get another stabilizer group.
  Code states of this new stabilizer code correspond to a \hyperref[topic:code-switching]{condensed phase} of the parent topological phase.
  The remaining unidentified parent-phase anyons behave differently with respect to the new condensed-phase state.
  Some become \textit{confined} while the remaining ones pick up new braiding relations.

  Gapped anyon theories admit a subgroup of bosons with trivial mutual statistics whose order squares to that of \(G\); see Ref. \cite{arxiv:2112.11394}.
  In terms of their category theoretic structure, gapped anyon theories admit a Lagrangian subgroup \cite{arxiv:1008.0654,arxiv:2107.13091}.
  It is conjectured that the logical dimension of an Abelian topological code on a torus is always a square \cite{arxiv:1008.0654}.

  \subsection{3D Abelian topological codes}

  While excitations are point-like in 2D topological codes, they can have higher dimension in 3D topological codes.
  For example, there are three types of \(\mathbb{Z}_2\) Abelian topological orders in 3D: one with bosonic charge and loop excitations (BcBl) and two with fermionic charge excitations and bosonic (FcBl) or fermionic (FcFl) loop excitations, respectively \cite{arxiv:2011.11165,arxiv:2110.14654}.
  The first two correspond to the 3D surface code and 3D fermionic surface code, while the FcFl case is purported not to have a commuting projector Hamiltonian realization \cite{arxiv:2110.14654}.
  There exists an invariant that distinguishes these \cite{arxiv:2110.14654}.

  \begin{defterm}{Amplitude damping noise}
  \label{topic:ad}
  The amplitude damping (AD) channel is a bosonic channel that models loss of particles in a bosonic mode (a.k.a. photon loss, pure loss, or fiber attenuation).
  Its Kraus operators are proportional to powers of a mode's annihilation operator \(a\), with the power signifying the number of particles lost during the error,
  \begin{align}
    E_{\ell}=\left(\frac{\gamma}{1-\gamma}\right)^{\ell/2}\frac{a^{\ell}}{\sqrt{\ell!}}\left(1-\gamma\right)^{\hat{n}/2}\,,
  \end{align}
  where \(\gamma\in[0,1)\) is the noise rate \cite{doi:10.1088/0954-8998/1/2/005,arxiv:1708.05010}.
  For multiple modes, error set elements are tensor products of elements of the single-mode error set. 

  Restricting the channel to the first two Fock states \(\{|0\rangle,|1\rangle\}\) yields the non-Pauli qubit AD channel, which requires protecting against the loss error \(E_1\propto X+iY\) (instead of \(X\) and \(Y\) Pauli errors individually). Both channels are called AD since the context makes clear which one is being referred to.
  Other extension to qudits are also known \cite{arxiv:2008.00477}.
  \end{defterm}

  Protection against \hyperref[topic:ad]{AD} noise is typically approximate because the tensor product of Kraus operators with all \(\ell=0\) is typically corrected only up to some order in \(\gamma\) \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/9704002,doi:10.1103/PhysRevA.56.1114}.
  For example, a qubit code that corrects a single \hyperref[topic:ad]{AD} error is one for which all tensor products \(E_{\ell_1}\otimes\cdots\otimes E_{\ell_n}\) with \(\ell_1+\cdots + \ell_n \leq 1\) are correctable (per the \term{Knill-Laflamme conditions}) up to \hyperref[topic:asymptotics]{order} \(O(\gamma^2)\).
   
  Certain codes also have intrinsic protection against \hyperref[topic:ad]{AD}, such as constant-excitation codes (CE), QSCs, or self-complementary codes.
  Amplitude damping can be thought of as a quantum analogue to asymmetric noise \cite{arxiv:1310.7536}.

# A definition of distance associated with \hyperref[topic:ad]{AD} is the minimum weight of a tensor products of loss errors that implement a nontrivial logical operation in the code.

features:
  rate: 'The quantum capacity of the \hyperref[topic:ad]{AD} channel is \(\max\{0, \log \frac{1-\gamma}{\gamma}\} \) \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/0606132}.
  Quantum capacities of the qubit \hyperref[topic:ad]{AD} channel are also determined \cite{arXiv:quant-ph/0405110,arXiv:1309.2219}, including of channels with memory \cite{arXiv:1207.5612,arXiv:1510.05313}. Capacities of qudit extensions have also been studied \cite{arxiv:2008.00477}.'

code_id: metopt

name: 'Error-corrected sensing code'
introduced: '\cite{arxiv:1704.06280,arxiv:1706.02445}'

description: |
  Code that can be obtained via an optimization procedure that ensures correction against a set \(\cal{E}\) of errors as well as guaranteeting optimal precision in locally estimating a parameter using a noiseless ancilla. For tensor-product spaces consisting of \(n\) subsystems (e.g., qubits, modular qudits, or Galois qudits), the procedure can yield a code whose parameter estimation precision satisfies \textit{Heisenberg scaling}, i.e., scales quadratically with the number \(n\) of subsystems.

  The conditions required for a code are that it corrects errors in the set \(\cal{E}\) and admits a continuous-parameter \(U(1)\) group of logical gates generated by some \textit{signal Hamiltonian} \(H\) (with the time of evolution by \(H\) the parameter that is to be estimated).
  This means that \(H\) cannot itself be a detectable error, i.e., \(H\) cannot be expressed as a linear combination of the errors, a condition known as the \textit{Hamiltonian-not-in-Kraus-span} condition \cite{arxiv:2003.10559} (alternatively, Hamiltonian-not-in-Lindblad-span for Markovian noise \cite{arxiv:1706.02445}; see also \cite{arxiv:2402.18765}).
  If these conditions are satisfied, a semidefinite-program based optimization procedure yields a metrologically optimal code.
  The procedure has been generalized to more general groups, corresponding to multiparameter estimation \cite{arxiv:1901.00896}.
  If these conditions are not satisfied, Heisenberg scaling is not achievable, but metrologically optimal codes can still be obtained via another semidefinite-program based optimization procedure \cite{arxiv:1910.08472,arxiv:2003.10559}.

  Metrologically optimal QECCs require error-free ancillas for optimal local parameter estimation using an entangling gate.
  In this sense, such codes can be thought of as being entanglement-assisted.
  \textit{Ancilla-free} versions exist in the case when the noise commutes with the signal Hamiltonian \cite{arxiv:1811.01450,arxiv:2303.00881}.

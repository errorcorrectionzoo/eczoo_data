code_id: covariant

name: 'Covariant block quantum code'
introduced: '\cite{arxiv:1709.04471}'

alternative_names:
  - 'Equivariant block quantum code'

description: |
  A block code on \(n\) subsystems that admits a group \(G\) of transversal gates. The group has to be finite for finite-dimensional codes due to the \hyperref[topic:eastin-knill]{Eastin-Knill theorem}.
  Continuous-\(G\) covariant codes, necessarily infinite-dimensional, are relevant to error correction of quantum reference frames \cite{arxiv:1709.04471} and error-corrected parameter estimation.

  Denoting the code's encoding map as \(U\), covariance is equivalent to
  \begin{align}
    \left(\bigotimes_{j=1}^{n}V_{j}\left(g\right)\right)U=UV_{L}\left(g\right)\quad\quad\forall g\in G\,,
  \end{align}
  where \(V_j(g)\) is a unitary representation of \(g\) acting on the \(j\) subsystem, and \(V_L\) is a unitary representation acting on the unencoded logical information.
  In this way, covariant encoding maps are equivariant (i.e., commute) with group actions on the logical and physical spaces.

  Almost always, the physical representation is defined to be the transversal one (with respect to some tensor-product decomposition), but can reduce to any representation when the code is a subspace of a larger space that is not expressed as a tensor product (\(n=1\)). More generally, a code is sometimes said to be \textit{time-covariant} if it admits a continuous-parameter \(U(1)\) family of gates, not necessarily transversal \cite{arxiv:2207.13707}.

#The physical group action is the unitary tensor product representation, making physical group actions intrinsically transversal with respect to the \(n\)-subsystem decomposition.

protection: |
  Finite-dimensional codes correcting a single-subsystem erasure and admitting a continuous-parameter family of transversal gates (assuming \(n>1\)) cannot exist in finite
  dimensions due to the \hyperref[topic:eastin-knill]{Eastin-Knill theorem}. As a result, there is generally a tradeoff between covariance and error correction.

  Exact error-correcting \(G\)-covariant codes can exist in infinite dimensions, but their codewords are non-normalizable, meaning that approximate constructions have to be considered that are only approximately error correcting.
  On the other hand, there exist exact error-correcting codes in finite dimensions that are approximately covariant \cite{arxiv:2111.06360,arxiv:2111.06355}.
  Various bounds quantify the covariance-performance tradeoff \cite{arxiv:1902.07714,arxiv:2005.11918,arxiv:2004.11893,arxiv:2111.06360,arxiv:2111.06355,arxiv:2410.07045,arxiv:2505.00427,arxiv:2510.04453}.

#  The noise model is an erasure of a known subset of the physical subsystems.
#  The ability to perfectly protect however depends on both the group and the
#  physical space.  A partial classification result is the following:
#  \begin{itemize}
#  \item A: The group contains a continuous symmetry and the total physical space
#  dimension is finite (i.e. a Lie group into qudits).  In this case, there cannot
##  \item B: finite group + finite physical, or, finite group + infinite physical.
#  In either case, perfect covariant codes exist \cite{arxiv:1709.04471}.
#  \end{itemize}
#  The above classification result may be thought of as a generalization of the
#  Eastin-Knill theorem \cite{arxiv:0811.4262}.  In particular, set the logical
#  space to be \(N\) qudits, the physical space to be a finite collection of
#  qudits, and \(G=U(N)\).  The existence of covariant codes perfectly correcting
#  against erasure in case B represents the in-principle ability to circumvent
#  the Eastin-Knill theorem.  Approximate codes for case A have been considered
#  in \cite{arxiv:1902.07714}.'

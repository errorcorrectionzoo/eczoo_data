name: 'W-state code'
introduced: '\cite{arxiv:1902.07714}'

description: |-
  Approximate block quantum code whose encoding resembles the structure of the
  W state~\cite{arxiv:quant-ph/0005115}.
  This code enables universal quantum computation with transversal gates.

  The encoding is of a \(d_L\)-dimensional Hilbert space into  \(n\) physical quantum systems, each associated with a Hilbert space
  of dimension \(d_L+1\):
  \begin{align}
    \ket\psi
    \to \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}\bigl(\ket{\psi\perp\perp\ldots}
    + \ket{\perp\psi\perp\ldots} + \cdots
    + \ket{\perp\perp\ldots\psi}\bigr)\ ,
  \end{align}
  where on each physical system, \(\ket\perp\) denotes the \((d_L+1)\)-th basis state,
  and \(\ket\psi\) is encoded using the first \(d_L\) basis states.

  Indeed, to apply any logical unitary \(U\) it suffices to apply \(U\) on each physical system,
  where the unitary is taken to act nontrivially only on the \(d_L\) first basis states
  of each system.  Universal computation with transversal gates does not violate the
  \hyperref[topic:eastin-knill]{Eastin-Knill theorem} because this code is an approximate error-correcting
  code~\cite{arxiv:1709.04471,arxiv:1902.07714} rather than an exact error-correcting
  code.

protection: |-
  The W state code is an approximate error-correcting code.  Intuitively, if a
  subsystem is lost to the environment, the environment only gains access to
  \(\ket\psi\) with probability of \hyperref[topic:asymptotics]{order} \(O(1/n)\).  Under a single located erasure,
  the worst-cast entanglement infidelity of the W state code can be upper bound as
  \begin{align}
    \epsilon_{\mathrm{worst}} \leq \frac{\sqrt{2} + d_L}{\sqrt{n}}\ .
  \end{align}

  In contrast to the \ref{code:eth}, the W state code does not saturate the scaling
  \(1/n\) in worst-case entanglement infidelity which is known to be
  optimal for covariant approximate error-correcting codes~\cite{arxiv:1902.07714}.

features:
  encoders:
    - 'There are complexity theoretical bounds on \(W\) state preparation \cite{arxiv:2510.04453}.'

  transversal_gates:
    - 'All logical gates can be implemented transversally.
    The logical unitary \(U_L\) can be performed with the physical unitary \(U_L\otimes U_L\otimes\cdots\otimes U_L\), where on
    the physical space \(U_L\) is taken to act trivially on \(\ket\perp\), i.e., \( U_L\ket\perp = \ket\perp\).'

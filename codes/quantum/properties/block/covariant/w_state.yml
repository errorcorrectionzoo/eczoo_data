name: 'W-state code'
introduced: '\cite{arXiv:1902.07714}'

description: |-
  Encodes a quantum state of a \(d_L\)-dimensional Hilbert space into
  \(n\) physical quantum systems, each associated with a Hilbert space
  of dimension \(d_L+1\).  The encoding resembles the structure of the
  W state~\cite{arXiv:quant-ph/0005115}:
  \begin{align}
    \ket\psi
    \to \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}\bigl(\ket{\psi\perp\perp\ldots}
    + \ket{\perp\psi\perp\ldots} + \cdots
    + \ket{\perp\perp\ldots\psi}\bigr)\ ,
  \end{align}
  where on each physical system, \(\ket\perp\) denotes the \((d_L+1)\)-th basis state
  and \(\ket\psi\) is encoded using the first \(d_L\) basis states.

  This code enables universal quantum computation with transversal gates.  Indeed,
  to apply any logical unitary \(U\) it suffices to apply \(U\) on each physical system,
  where the unitary is taken to act nontrivially only on the \(d_L\) first basis states
  of each system.  Universal computation with transversal gates does not violate the
  Eastin-Knill theorem because this code is an approximate error-correcting
  code~\cite{arXiv:1709.04471,arXiv:1902.07714} rather than an exact error-correcting
  code.

protection: |-
  The W state code is an approximate error-correcting code.  Intuitively, if a
  subsystem is lost to the environment, the environment only gains access to
  \(\ket\psi\) with probability of order \(1/n\).  Under a single located erasure,
  the worst-cast entanglement infidelity of the W state code can be upper bound as
  \begin{align}
    \epsilon_{\mathrm{worst}} \leq \frac{\sqrt{2} + d_L}{\sqrt{n}}\ .
  \end{align}

  In contrast to the \ref{code:eth}, the W state code does not saturate the scaling
  \(1/n\) in worst-case entanglement infidelity which is known to be
  optimal for covariant approximate error-correcting codes~\cite{arXiv:1902.07714}.

features:

  transversal_gates: |-
    All logical gates can be implemented transversally. The logical unitary \(U_L\) can be
    performed with the physical unitary \(U_L\otimes U_L\otimes\cdots\otimes U_L\), where on
    the physical space \(U_L\) is taken to act trivially on \(\ket\perp\), i.e.,
    \( U_L\ket\perp = \ket\perp\).

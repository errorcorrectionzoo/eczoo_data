name: 'Approximate quantum error-correcting code (AQECC)'
short_name: 'AQECC'
introduced: '\cite{arxiv:quant-ph/9704002,doi:10.1070/RM1997v052n06ABEH002155,arXiv:quant-ph/0307138,arXiv:quant-ph/0503139,arXiv:0907.4207,arXiv:0907.5391,arxiv:1706.09434}'

description: 'Encodes quantum information so that it is possible to approximately recover that information from noise up to an error bound in recovery.'

# In exact quantum error correction, we say that encoding \(\mathcal{E}\) is correctable
# under noise channel \(\mathcal{N}\) iff there exists some channel \(\mathcal{D}\) such that
# \begin{align}\mathcal{D}\mathcal{N}\mathcal{E}\ket{\psi}\bra{\psi}=\ket{\psi}\bra{\psi}\end{align}
# for all \(\ket{\psi}\).
#
# This can be interpreted as pure state fidelity being equal to 1 for all pure states \(\ket{\psi}\). This is true
# iff entanglement fidelity, another measure of error, is also equal to 1 for all
# quantum states \(\rho\)~\cite{arxiv:quant-ph/9604022}.
# In the \hyperref[code:qecc_finite]{exact case},
# this means that for all \(\rho\) where \(\ket{\psi}\) is a purification of \(\rho\),
# \begin{align}(\mathcal{D}\mathcal{N}\mathcal{E}\otimes\mathrm{id})(\ket{\psi}\bra{\psi})=\ket{\psi}\bra{\psi}.\end{align}

protection: |
  Many of the state fidelity conditions that hold exactly for \hyperref[code:qecc_finite]{(exact) QECCs} can be shown to hold up to some error \(\epsilon\) for approximate QECCs.

  \subsection{Entanglement fidelity}

  Let \(f(\rho_1,\rho_2)\) be the fidelity between quantum states.
  Let entanglement fidelity between channels \(\mathcal{N}\) and \(\mathcal{M}\) be defined as
  \begin{align}
    F_{\rho}(\mathcal{N},\mathcal{M})
    =f((\mathcal{N}\otimes\mathrm{id})\ket{\psi}\bra{\psi},(\mathcal{M}\otimes\mathrm{id})\ket{\psi}\bra{\psi})~,
  \end{align}
  where \(\ket{\psi}\) is a purification of the mixed state \(\rho\).
  The worst-case entaglement fidelity is then defined as
  \begin{align}
    F(\mathcal{N},\mathcal{M})=\min_{\rho} F_{\rho}(\mathcal{N},\mathcal{M})~.
  \end{align}

  Now, based on the Bures distance and worst case entaglement fidelity, we define
  \begin{align}
    d(\mathcal{N},\mathcal{M})=\sqrt{1-F(\mathcal{N},\mathcal{M})}
  \end{align}
  as a measure of distance between quantum channels~\cite{arXiv:0907.5391}.

  Given some encoding map \(\mathcal{U}\) and some noise channel \(\mathcal{E}\),
  the code described by \(\mathcal{U}\) is \textit{\(\epsilon\)-correctable} if there exists
  some quantum channel \(\mathcal{D}\) such that
  \begin{align}
    d(\mathcal{D}\mathcal{E}\mathcal{U}(\rho),\rho)\leq \epsilon
  \end{align}
  for all logical states \(\rho\)~\cite{arXiv:0907.5391}.

  \subsection{Complementary channel formulation}

  \subsection{Necessary and sufficient approximate error-correction conditions}
  Analogously to the \term{Knill-Laflamme conditions} for (exact) QECCs, there exist various formulations of necessary and sufficient conditions for approximate error correction to determine if some code is \(\epsilon\)-correctable under a noise channel.

  Necessary and sufficient conditions for approximate error correction can also be expressed in terms of
  complementary channels.
  Given some code defined by projector \(\Pi = U U^\dagger\), \(\Pi\) is \textit{\(\epsilon\)-correctable}
  with respect to some noise channel \(\mathcal{E}\) if
  \begin{align}
    \Pi E_i^{\dagger}E_j \Pi =\lambda_{ij}\Pi +\Pi B_{ij}\Pi ~,
  \end{align}
  where \(\Lambda(\rho)=\mathrm{Tr}(\rho)\sum_{ij} \lambda_{ij}|i\rangle\langle j|\)
  is a density operator,
  \begin{align}
    (\Lambda+B)(\rho)=\Lambda(\rho)+\sum_{ij}\mathrm{Tr}(\rho B_{ij})|i\rangle\langle j|
  \end{align}
  is the output state of the complementary noise channel \(\mathcal{E}^C = \Lambda+B\), and the Bures distance \(d(\Lambda+B,\Lambda)\le\epsilon\)~\cite{arXiv:0907.5391}.

  In addition to the necessary and sufficient error correction conditions,
  there exist sufficient conditions for AQECCs.
  Given a noise channel \(\mathcal{U}(\rho)=\sum_{n} A_n \rho A_n^{\dagger}\) where \(\forall{n}\), \(A_n\) is a Kraus operator, and code projector \(\Pi \), express the following using polar decomposition, \(A_n \Pi =U_n \sqrt{\Pi A_n^{\dagger}A_n \Pi }\), and let \(p_n\) and \(p_n\lambda_n\) be the largest and smallest eigenvalues for \(\Pi A_n^{\dagger}A_n \Pi \).
  Then, we are guaranteed that if
  \begin{align}\Pi U_m^{\dagger}U_n \Pi =\delta_{mn} \Pi  \land p_n(1-\lambda_n)\le O(f(\epsilon))\end{align}
  we have a fidelity \(F \geq 1-O(f(\epsilon))\) after recovery~\cite{arXiv:quant-ph/9704002}.

  \subsection{Universal subspace AQECCs and alpha-bits}
  Universal subspace approximate error correction is a type of approximate error correction that quantifies protection of information stored in (strict) subspaces of a logical space.

  Given a subspace of a Hilbert space \(\mathsf{S}\) of dimension \(d\), noise channel \(\mathcal{E}\), and encoding \(\mathcal{U}\), we define the subspace as an \textit{\(\alpha\)-dit} with error \(\epsilon\) if, for all subspaces \(\tilde{\mathsf{S}}\) of dimension less than or equal to \(d^{\alpha}+1\),
  there exists some channel \(\tilde{\mathcal{D}}\) such that
  \begin{align}||(\tilde{\mathcal{D}}\circ \mathcal{E}\circ \mathcal{U})|\psi\rangle-|\psi\rangle||_1\leq \epsilon\end{align}
  for all \(|\psi\rangle\in \tilde{\mathsf{S}}\)~\cite{arXiv:1706.09434}.

  Generalizing the notion of quantum information transmission and capacity of \hyperref[code:qecc_finite]{(exact) QECCs}, one can achieve an \(\alpha\)-bit transmission rate \(r\) quantum channel \(\mathcal{E}\) iff,
  for sufficiently large \(d\) and \(n\), and for all \(\epsilon>0\), the channel \(\mathcal{E}^{\otimes n}\)
  is able to transmit
  \begin{align}\lceil \frac{n r}{\log(d)} \rceil\quad \textup{\(\alpha\)-dits}\end{align}
  with total error \(\epsilon\) across those \(\alpha\)-dits.
  The \(\alpha\)-bit capacity \(Q\) of \(\mathcal{E}\)
  is defined as the supremum of achievable transmission rates~\cite{arXiv:1706.09434}.

# Please remove calM from, first discussing the codespace case and then opening up to algebras.

# Given a noise channel \(\mathcal{E}\), there exists a recovery channel \(\mathcal{D}\) such that
# \(F(\mathcal{D}\mathcal{E},\mathcal{M})=1-\epsilon\) iff there exists some \(\mathcal{D}'\) such that
# for complementary channels \(\mathcal{E}^C\) and \(\mathcal{M}^C\), \(F(\mathcal{E}^C,\mathcal{D}'\mathcal{M}^C)=1-\epsilon\).
# Note that \(F\) denotes worst case entaglement fidelity between channels.
#
# One example is that if \(\mathcal{M}\) is the projector onto some algebra \(\mathcal{A}\),
# we can derive correctability conditions for that algebra under \(\mathcal{E}\)~\cite{arXiv:0907.5391}.

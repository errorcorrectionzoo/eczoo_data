name: 'Approximate quantum error-correcting code (AQECC)'
short_name: 'AQECC'
introduced: '\cite{arxiv:quant-ph/9704002,doi:10.1070/RM1997v052n06ABEH002155,arxiv:quant-ph/0307138,arxiv:quant-ph/0503139,arxiv:0907.4207,arxiv:0907.5391,arxiv:1706.09434}'

description: |
  Encodes quantum information so that it is possible to approximately recover that information from noise up to an error bound in recovery.

  Many families of approximate block quantum codes become exact in the \(n\to\infty\) limit (see children).
  More generally, codes that become exact for some parameter values are called \textit{quasi exact} \cite{arxiv:2105.14777}.

protection: |
  Many of the state fidelity conditions that hold exactly for \hyperref[code:qecc_finite]{(exact) QECCs} can be shown to hold up to some error \(\epsilon\) for approximate QECCs.
  Approximate correction has been formulated for certain types of correlated noise \cite{arxiv:0909.1466}.

  \subsection{Entanglement fidelity}

  Let \(f(\rho_1,\rho_2)\) be the fidelity between quantum states.
  Let entanglement fidelity between channels \(\mathcal{N}\) and \(\mathcal{M}\) be defined as
  \begin{align}
    F_{\rho}(\mathcal{N},\mathcal{M})
    =f((\mathcal{N}\otimes\mathrm{id})\ket{\psi}\bra{\psi},(\mathcal{M}\otimes\mathrm{id})\ket{\psi}\bra{\psi})~,
  \end{align}
  where \(\ket{\psi}\) is a purification of the mixed state \(\rho\).
  The worst-case entanglement fidelity is then defined as
  \begin{align}
    F(\mathcal{N},\mathcal{M})=\min_{\rho} F_{\rho}(\mathcal{N},\mathcal{M})~.
  \end{align}

  Now, based on the Bures distance and worst case entanglement fidelity, we define
  \begin{align}
    d(\mathcal{N},\mathcal{M})=\sqrt{1-F(\mathcal{N},\mathcal{M})}
  \end{align}
  as a measure of distance between quantum channels~\cite{arxiv:0907.5391}.

  Given some encoding map \(\mathcal{U}\) and some noise channel \(\mathcal{E}\),
  the code described by \(\mathcal{U}\) is \textit{\(\epsilon\)-correctable} if there exists
  some quantum channel \(\mathcal{D}\) such that
  \begin{align}
    d(\mathcal{D}\mathcal{E}\mathcal{U}(\rho),\rho)\leq \epsilon
  \end{align}
  for all logical states \(\rho\)~\cite{arxiv:0907.5391}.
  When \(\epsilon=0\) we can derive the standard \term{Knill-Laflamme conditions} \cite{arXiv:1102.3809}.

  Upper and lower bounds based on the average entanglement fidelity can be derived \cite[Eq. (10)]{arxiv:0907.5391}\cite[Eqs. (138-139)]{arXiv:0907.3386}\cite[Eq. (139)]{arXiv:1103.0649}.
  Riemannian optimization techniques can be applied to optimized such quantities since the set of encoding maps \(U\) forms a Stiefel manifold \cite{arxiv:2407.08423}.

  \subsection{Complementary channel formulation}

  Given a noise channel \(\mathcal{E}\), there exists a recovery channel \(\mathcal{D}\) such that
  \(F(\mathcal{D}\mathcal{E},\mathrm{id})=1-\epsilon\) iff there exists some \(\mathcal{D}'\) such that
  for \hyperref[topic:complementary-channel]{complementary channel} \(\mathcal{E}^C\), \(F(\mathcal{E}^C,\mathcal{D}')=1-\epsilon\)
  and \(D'(\rho)=\rho_0\) for some fixed \(\rho_0\).
  Note that \(F\) denotes worst case entanglement fidelity between channels.

  We can generalize this by replacing \(\mathrm{id}\) with some channel \(M\). Given noise channel \(\mathcal{E}\),
  there exists a recovery channel \(\mathcal{D}\) such that
  \(F(\mathcal{D}\mathcal{E},\mathcal{M})=1-\epsilon\) iff there exists some \(\mathcal{D}'\) such that
  for \hyperref[topic:complementary-channel]{complementary channel} \(\mathcal{E}^C\), \(F(\mathcal{E}^C,\mathcal{D}'\mathcal{M}^C)=1-\epsilon\) \cite{arxiv:0907.5391}.

  \subsection{Necessary and sufficient approximate error-correction conditions}
  Analogously to the \term{Knill-Laflamme conditions} for (exact) QECCs, there exist various formulations of necessary and sufficient conditions for approximate error correction to determine if some code is \(\epsilon\)-correctable under a noise channel.

  Necessary and sufficient conditions for approximate error correction can also be expressed in terms of
  \hyperref[topic:complementary-channel]{complementary channels}.
  Given some code defined by projector \(\Pi = U U^\dagger\), \(\Pi\) is \textit{\(\epsilon\)-correctable}
  with respect to some noise channel \(\mathcal{E}\) if
  \begin{align}
    \Pi E_i^{\dagger}E_j \Pi =\lambda_{ij}\Pi +\Pi B_{ij}\Pi ~,
  \end{align}
  where \(\Lambda(\rho)=\mathrm{Tr}(\rho)\sum_{ij} \lambda_{ij}|i\rangle\langle j|\)
  is a density operator,
  \begin{align}
    (\Lambda+B)(\rho)=\Lambda(\rho)+\sum_{ij}\mathrm{Tr}(\rho B_{ij})|i\rangle\langle j|
  \end{align}
  is the output state of the complementary noise channel \(\mathcal{E}^C = \Lambda+B\), and the Bures distance \(d(\Lambda+B,\Lambda)\le\epsilon\)~\cite{arxiv:0907.5391}.
  An alternative measure, the \textit{AQEC relative entropy}, measures the relative entropy between \(\Lambda + B\) and \(\Lambda\) \cite{arxiv:2312.16991}.
  The non-correctable contributions \(B_{ij}\) can be arranged in a signature vector \cite{arxiv:2410.07983}. 
  The Frobenius norm of the matrix \(B_{ij}\) bounds the difference between the two \hyperref[topic:quantum-weight-enumerator]{quantum weight enumerators} \cite{arxiv:2108.04434}.

  In addition to the necessary and sufficient error correction conditions,
  there exist sufficient conditions for AQECCs.
  Given a noise channel \(\mathcal{U}(\rho)=\sum_{n} A_n \rho A_n^{\dagger}\) where \(\forall{n}\), \(A_n\) is a Kraus operator, and code projector \(\Pi \), express the following using polar decomposition, \(A_n \Pi =U_n \sqrt{\Pi A_n^{\dagger}A_n \Pi }\), and let \(p_n\) and \(p_n\lambda_n\) be the largest and smallest eigenvalues for \(\Pi A_n^{\dagger}A_n \Pi \).
  Then, we are guaranteed that if
  \begin{align}\Pi U_m^{\dagger}U_n \Pi =\delta_{mn} \Pi  \land p_n(1-\lambda_n)\le O(f(\epsilon))\end{align}
  we have a fidelity \(F \geq 1-O(f(\epsilon))\) after recovery~\cite{arxiv:quant-ph/9704002}.

  If parts of the \term{Knill-Laflamme conditions} are violated, a deterministic recovery operation is not possible. However, a probabilistic recovery and a modified version of the conditions can still be constructed \cite{arxiv:2410.00155}.

  \subsection{Universal subspace AQECCs and alpha-bits}

  Universal subspace approximate error correction is a type of approximate error correction that quantifies protection of information stored in (strict) subspaces of a logical space.
  See also formulations of error corrections for subsets that are not necessarily subspaces \cite{arxiv:2112.01858}.

  Given a subspace of a Hilbert space \(\mathsf{S}\) of dimension \(d\), noise channel \(\mathcal{E}\), and encoding \(\mathcal{U}\), we define the subspace as an \textit{\(\alpha\)-dit} with error \(\epsilon\) if, for all subspaces \(\tilde{\mathsf{S}}\) of dimension less than or equal to \(d^{\alpha}+1\),
  there exists some channel \(\tilde{\mathcal{D}}\) such that
  \begin{align}||(\tilde{\mathcal{D}}\circ \mathcal{E}\circ \mathcal{U})|\psi\rangle-|\psi\rangle||_1\leq \epsilon\end{align}
  for all \(|\psi\rangle\in \tilde{\mathsf{S}}\)~\cite{arxiv:1706.09434}.

  Generalizing the notion of quantum information transmission and capacity of \hyperref[code:qecc_finite]{(exact) QECCs}, one can achieve an \(\alpha\)-bit transmission rate \(r\) quantum channel \(\mathcal{E}\) iff,
  for sufficiently large \(d\) and \(n\), and for all \(\epsilon>0\), the channel \(\mathcal{E}^{\otimes n}\)
  is able to transmit
  \begin{align}\left\lceil \frac{n r}{\log(d)} \right\rceil\quad \textup{\(\alpha\)-dits}\end{align}
  with total error \(\epsilon\) across those \(\alpha\)-dits.
  The \(\alpha\)-bit capacity \(Q\) of \(\mathcal{E}\)
  is defined as the supremum of achievable transmission rates~\cite{arxiv:1706.09434}.

  \subsection{Circuit complexity}

  \begin{defterm}{Code space complexity}
  \label{topic:codespace-complexity}
  One can relate robustness of an approximate quantum code to the quantum \textit{circuit complexity} \cite{arxiv:1210.1281,arxiv:1402.5674,arxiv:1301.1363,arxiv:1607.05256} of creating states in the codespace.
  For a family of block codes, scaling as \hyperref[topic:asymptotics]{order} \(O(k/n)\) of a code parameter called the \textit{subsystem variance} characterizes the transition between code subspaces with low and high circuit complexity \cite{arxiv:2310.04710}.
  \end{defterm}



# Please remove calM from, first discussing the codespace case and then opening up to algebras.

# \subsection{Complementary channel formulation}

# Given a noise channel \(\mathcal{E}\), there exists a recovery channel \(\mathcal{D}\) such that
# \(F(\mathcal{D}\mathcal{E},\mathcal{M})=1-\epsilon\) iff there exists some \(\mathcal{D}'\) such that
# for complementary channels \(\mathcal{E}^C\) and \(\mathcal{M}^C\), \(F(\mathcal{E}^C,\mathcal{D}'\mathcal{M}^C)=1-\epsilon\).
# Note that \(F\) denotes worst case entanglement fidelity between channels.
#
# One example is that if \(\mathcal{M}\) is the projector onto some algebra \(\mathcal{A}\),
# we can derive correctability conditions for that algebra under \(\mathcal{E}\)~\cite{arxiv:0907.5391}.

name: 'Monitored random-circuit code'

description: |
  Error-correcting code arising from a monitored random circuit. Such a circuit is described by a series of intermittant random local projective Pauli measurements with random unitary time-evolution operators.
  An important sub-family consists of \textit{Clifford monitored random circuits}, where unitaries are sampled from the Clifford group \cite{arxiv:1901.08092}.
  When the rate of projective measurements is independently controlled by a probability parameter \(p\), there can exist two stable phases, one described by volume-law entanglement entropy and the other by area-law entanglement entropy.
  The phases and their transition can be understood from the perspective of quantum error correction, information scrambling, and channel capacities \cite{arXiv:1903.05124,arXiv:1905.05195}.

  Monitored random circuits have a finite information capacity that decays exponentially with respect to system size \cite{arXiv:1905.05195}. When \( p = 0 \), the random circuit achieves channel capacity, meaning that it stores the most amount of information possible.
  This notion quantifies the recoverability of information and the reversability of the system under the monitored random dynamics. In the volume-law phase (\( p < p_c \) for some critical probability \(p_c\)), the channel capacity remains non-zero, and the monitored channel projects an initial state into a random error-correcting code \cite{arXiv:1905.05195}.
  With appropriately chosen evolution operators and measurements, the code is a stabilizer code whose parameters depend on time, \( [[n,k(t),d(t)]] \).
  A similar notion applies to Haar random circuits with measurements \cite{arXiv:1911.00008}.

#  In this case, the time-evolved projective measurement at time step \(j\) is given by \( P_j = U_{\tau} \cdots U_j P_j^’ (U_{\tau} \cdots U_j)^{\dagger} \). Thus the monitored random circuit just implements a series of projective measurements at various time steps.
#The entanglement phase transition between the two phases at a critical probability \(p=p_c\) has been shown to be equivalent to the purification transition when starting in an mixed initial state \cite{arXiv:1905.05195}.

#The quantum channel capacity indicates how long information is stored in the system.

# In the area-law phase (\( p > p_c \)), the density of the channel capasity converges to zero.
#  \textbf{Clifford monitored random circuits}: When considering unitary evolutions, it can be useful to consider unitaries randomly sampled from the Clifford group. In this case, the time-evolved projective measurement at time step \(j\) is given by \( P_j = U_{\tau} \cdots U_j P_j^’ (U_{\tau} \cdots U_j)^{\dagger} \). Thus the monitored random circuit just implements a series of projective measurements at various time steps.'

protection: 'When in the volume-law phase, protects against random projective measurements at a rate \( p < p_c \). While the true code distance is not known, it is conjectured to be proportional to the contiguous distance. As first described in Ref. \cite{arXiv:1905.05195}, the  contiguous distance for these circuits is defined with respect to all partitions of the system.'

features:

  rate: 'Rate can be finite \cite{arXiv:1905.05195}, depending on the family of random codes generated by the circuit.'

  encoders:
    - 'The dynamics of the monitored random circuit can be recast in the language of stabilizer codes \cite{arXiv:1905.05195}. The stabilizer group of the error-correcting code resulting from a monitored Clifford circuit either grows or shrinks with each time step, depending on which projective measurements were performed during the time step.'
    - 'One can construct optimal single-copy encoding operations for strong purification transitions \cite{arXiv:1905.05195}'

#    can be recursively defined as \( {\mathsf S }^{(t)} = \langle P_{\tau}, {\mathsf S }^{( \tau - 1)} \rangle \). The number of stabilizers increases if and only if the next Pauli \( P_{\tau+1} \) commutes with the operators in \( {\mathsf S }^{\tau} \) . If not, then the Pauli operators which do not commute with  \( P_{\tau} \) are removed and \( P_{\tau} \) is added. The likelihood of randomly generating a \( P_{\tau} \) which commutes with all the Pauli strings in the stabilizer is low when the stabilizer group is already large (at entanglement equilibrium).'

  threshold:
    - 'Above the critical measurement rate \( p_c\), the natural error correction properties of the circuit can no longer protect the information. This can be interpreted as the code threshold.'
    - 'These dynamically generated codes saturate the trade off between density of encoded information and the error rate threshold \cite{arXiv:1905.05195}'

realizations:
  - 'Measurement induced quantum phases have been realized in a trapped-ion processor \cite{arXiv:2106.05881}.'

notes:
  - 'Connections to information scrambling in black hole physics, as introduced in Section 11 of \cite{arXiv:1903.05124}. In particular, monitored random circuits can be viewed as the Hayden-Preskill recovery problem \cite{doi:10.1103/PhysRevD.100.086001} running backwards in time. In this setting, the volume-law entanglement phase of the monitored circuit describes the phase when information can be recovered from an old black hole (ie, a black hole that is maximally entangled with the early universe).'
  - 'Mapping monitored random circuits to statistical mechanics models can help estimate thresholds and code distances for these systems \cite{arXiv:2007.03822}.'

code_id: symmetry_protected_self_correct

name: 'Symmetry-protected self-correcting quantum code'
introduced: '\cite{arXiv:1805.01474}'

description: |
  Also called a \textit{symmetry-protected self-correcting memory}. An restricted notion of thermal stability against symmetric perturbations, i.e., perturbations that commute with a set of operators forming a group \(G\) called the \textit{symmetry group}.

  Given a symmetry group \(G\) and its unitary representation \(S\) on the \(n\)-site physical Hilbert space (in this case, a lattice), an operator \(O\) is \(G\)\textit{-symmetric} (a.k.a. respects the \(G\) symmetry) if \([S(g),O]=0\) for all \(g\in G\). A symmetry-protected self-correcting memory is a ground-state encoding of an \(n\)-body \(G\)-symmetric geometrically local Hamiltonian whose logical information is recoverable for arbitrary long times in the \(n\to\infty\) limit after a \(G\)-symmetric interaction with a thermal environment at sufficiently low temperature.

  Tensor-product symmetries of the form \(S(g)=u(g)^{\otimes n}\), where \(u\) is a unitary representation of \(G\ni g\) on a site, cannot support symmetry-protected self-correction. One can instead use \textit{one-form symmetries}, i.e., symmetries generated by operators of the form
  \begin{align}
    S_{\mathcal{M}}(g)=\bigotimes_{\text{sites}\in\mathcal{M}}u(g),
  \end{align}
  where \(\mathcal{M}\) runs over all closed codimension-one submanifolds of the lattice. Recent work further relaxed the requirement so that symmetries need only be enforced on the system's boundaries \cite{arxiv:2206.05294}.

#The codespace is the degenerate ground space of a Hamiltonian \(H\) that respects the symmetry and consists of terms local on the lattice. The required symmetry-protected self-correcting property is described as follows.
#  Suppose the physical state of the system \(\rho(0)\) at time \(t=0\) is a codeword, and is evolved to \(\rho(t)\) by \(H\) plus a small coupling to a thermal bath with a low enough temperature. In addition, suppose that the coupling consists of terms of the form \(A_\text{system}\otimes B_\text{bath}\), such that \(A_\text{system}\) is local on the lattice and respects the symmetry. Then the memory time is defined as
#  \begin{align}
#    \tau=\sup\left\{\,t>0\mid\left\|\Phi_\text{ec}(\rho(t))-\rho(0)\right\|_1<\epsilon\,\right\},
#  \end{align}
#  where \(\Phi_\text{ec}\) is the error correcting map and \(\epsilon\) a fixed error rate.
#  \(\tau\) is required to grow without bound (typically exponentially) in the system size.
#  In addition, the logical operators are required to have a decomposition into a product such that each factor is local on the lattice and respects the symmetry.

protection: |
  The code is intended to be used as a self-correcting quantum memory when the symmetry is enforced, and protection is characterized by the scaling of the memory time \(\tau\) in the system size.

  Another characterization of the protection property is the symmetric version of the energy barrier \(\Delta\), defined as follows.
  For a given logical operator and a given decomposition into a product of local operators, we consider the maximal energy attained when implementing this logical operator stepwise with this decomposition. Then, \(\Delta\) is defined by minimizing this quantity over all logical operators and over those decompositions for which each local operator respects the symmetry. For some models \cite{arXiv:1805.01474}, the linear growth of \(\Delta\) with system size \(n\) implies the exponential growth of \(\tau\) below a critical temperature.

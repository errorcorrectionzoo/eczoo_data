code_id: hamiltonian

name: 'Hamiltonian-based code'
#introduced: ''

description: |
  Encoding corresponds to a set of energy eigenstates of a quantum-mechanical Hamiltonian.
  The codespace is typically a set of low-energy eigenstates or ground states, but can include subspaces of arbitrarily high energy.

  For block quantum codes, the Hamiltonian can be \textit{local}, i.e., consisting of operators acting on a number of subsystems that is independent of the total number of subsystems (e.g., \hyperref[code:qldpc]{QLDPC codes}).
  When the physical space is endowed with a geometry, the Hamiltonian is typically \textit{geometrically local}, consisting of operators acting on subsystems that occupy a region whose size is independent of the number of subsystems (e.g., \hyperref[code:topological]{topological codes}).

  Ground states of infinite families geometrically local block-code Hamiltonians can sometimes be said to be a particular phase of (quantum) matter.
  A phase is a "region in some parameter space in which the ... states possess properties that can be distinguished from those in other phases" \cite{doi:10.1063/PT.3.1641}.
  For a large collection of similar subsystems, a phase is a region in some parameter space in which the thermal equilibrium states possess some properties in common that can be distinguished from those in other phases.

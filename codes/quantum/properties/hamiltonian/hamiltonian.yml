code_id: hamiltonian

name: 'Hamiltonian-based code'
#introduced: ''

description: |
  Code whose codespace corresponds to a set of energy eigenstates of a quantum-mechanical Hamiltonian i.e., a Hermitian operator whose expectation value measures the energy of its underlying physical system.
  The codespace is typically a set of low-energy eigenstates or ground states, but can include subspaces of arbitrarily high energy.
  Hamiltonians whose eigenstates are the canonical basis elements are called \textit{classical}; otherwise, a Hamiltonian is called \textit{quantum}.

  A Hamiltonian whose ground states minimize the energy of each term is called a frustration-free Hamiltonian.
  A Hamiltonian whose terms commute and can be written as orthogonal projectors (i.e., with eigenvalues zero or one) is called a commuting projector Hamiltonian.

  For block quantum codes, the code Hamiltonian is typically written as a sum of terms, with each term acting on at most some number \(K\) of subsystems (i.e., being of weight at most \(K\)).
  When \(K\) is independent of the total number of subsystems (e.g., \hyperref[code:qldpc]{QLDPC codes}), the Hamiltonian is called a \(K\)\textit{-body} or \(K\)\textit{-local} Hamiltonian.
  Otherwise, the Hamiltonian is called \textit{non-local}.
  When the physical space is endowed with a geometry, the Hamiltonian is typically \textit{geometrically local}, consisting of operators acting on subsystems that occupy a region whose size is independent of the number of subsystems.

  The notion of locality can be softened to include Hamiltonians whose terms each act non-trivially on all sites, but whose support on regions farther and farther from some designated central site decaying super-polynomially with the radius from the center.
  Such Hamiltonians are called \textit{quasi-local Hamiltonians} (a.k.a. almost local or approximately local).

  \subsection{Quantum phases of matter}

  Ground states of infinite families geometrically local block-code Hamiltonians on tesselations of Euclidean geometries are said to be in a particular \textit{phase of quantum matter}, i.e., a region in some parameter space of Hamiltonians "in which [ground] states possess properties that can be distinguished from those in other phases" \cite{doi:10.1063/PT.3.1641}.
  For example, \hyperref[code:topological]{topological code} Hamiltonians realize a particular phase called a topological phase.

  Hamiltonians realizing different phases cannot be adiabatically deformed into one another without a closing of the energy gap between the ground and excited states.
  Such adiabatic deformations naively would be generated by non-local Hamiltonians.
  However, Hastings and Wen \cite{arxiv:cond-mat/0503554} (see also \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/0601019,arxiv:2205.10460}) showed that adiabatic evolution can in fact be generated by a quasi-local operator; such evolution is often called \textit{quasi-adiabatic evolution}, \textit{quasi-adiabatic continuation}, or \textit{spectral flow}.

  Two states in the same phases can be deformed into one another by evolving, via quasi-adiabatic evolution, for a time independent of the system size \(n\) \cite[Appendix]{arxiv:1004.3835}.
  The unitary operation generated by a quasi-local Hamiltonian can be simulated by a quantum circuit, with the time of evolution determining the depth of the circuit.
  Approximating such constant-time evolution with constant error using a quantum circuit can be done in constant depth for finite system size \cite{doi:10.1126/science.273.5278.1073}.
  For infinite system size, Haah proved that every bounded local Hamiltonian evolution is a limit of a sequence of locality-preserving automorphisms (a.k.a. quantum cellular automata, or QCAs) \cite[Thm. A.17]{arxiv:2211.02086}.

  States in certain phases (e.g., \hyperref[code:topological]{topological phases}) remain in said phases even after evolving for longer times (e.g., times that are logarithmic in \(n\)).
  This means that circuits of non-constant depth may leave a state in the same phase, making the phase classification problem quantum computationally hard \cite{arxiv:2407.07754}.
  More general phases of matter are also computationally hard to recognize, even for quantum computers \cite{arxiv:2510.08503}.

  A state \(|\psi\rangle\) in an \textit{invertible phase} \cite{arxiv:1610.03911} can be deformed to a product state if it is first tensored with other states in related invertible phases that are realized on copies of the underlying lattice of \(|\psi\rangle\).
  Invertible phases are sometimes referred to as \textit{short-range entangled phases} \cite{manual:{Alexei Kitaev, Toward Topological Classification of Phases with Short-range Entanglement, talk at KITP (2011)},manual:{Alexei Kitaev, On the Classification of Short-Range Entangled States, talk at Simons Center (2013)}}, and their low-energy excitations are often characterized by invertible field theories \cite{arxiv:1406.7278}.

  Ground states of many Hamiltonians can be easily written as tensor-network states or, in 1D, matrix product states (MPS).
  A no-go theorem states that open-boundary MPS that form a degenerate ground-state space of a gapped local Hamiltonian yield codes with distance that is only constant in the number of qubits \(n\), so MPS excitation ansatze have to be used to achieve a distance scaling nontrivially with \(n\) \cite{arxiv:1902.02115} (see also Ref. \cite{arxiv:1407.3413}).

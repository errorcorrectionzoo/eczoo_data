code_id: hypergraph_product
physical: qubits
logical: qubits

name: 'Hypergraph product code'
introduced: '\cite{arXiv:0903.0566,arxiv:1202.0928}'

description: 'A family of \([[n,k,d]]\) CSS codes whose construction is based on two binary linear \textit{seed} codes \(C_1\) and \(C_2\).'
# Could be expanded to include Tanner graphs
# Defn of CSS has been changed to accomodate this... In contrast to the original CSS construction there are no restrictions on the form of \(C_1\) and \(C_2\).'

protection: 'The hypergraph product has distance \(d=O(\sqrt{n})\). The number of encoded logical qubits is \(k=O(k_1k_2)\) where \(k_1\) and \(k_2\) are the dimensions of the classical seed codes \(C_1\) and \(C_2\).'

#notes:
# VVA: Added already as cousin entry. - 'The surface code can be constructed form the hypergraph product of two repetition codes. Similarily, the toric code is obtained from the hypergraph product of two closed-loop repetition codes.'

features:
  general_gates:
    - 'Code deformation techniques yield Clifford gates \cite{arXiv:1909.07424}.'

# realizations:
  # -

relations:
  parents: # Probably can just have hypergraph_product as sole parent
    - code_id: lifted_product
      detail: 'Lifted-product codes for trivial group \(G\) are hypergraph-product codes.'
    - code_id: homological_product
      detail: 'A homological product of chain complexes corresponding to two classical codes is a hypergraph product code \cite{arxiv:2009.03921}.'
#    - code_id: css
#      detail: '\(X\)- and \(Z\)-type checks are based on the classical seed matrices \(C_1\) and \(C_2\).'
#    - code_id: homological_product
#      detail: 'Hypergraph product obtained from the homological product of two length-two chain complexes, i.e., classical binary codes.'
#    - code_id: qldpc
#      detail: 'Sparsity of seed codes \(C_1\) and \(C_2\) preserved by the hypergraph product (up to a constant factor), yielding a QLDPC code.'

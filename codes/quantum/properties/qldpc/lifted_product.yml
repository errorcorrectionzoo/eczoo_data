name: Lifted-product (LP) code
introduced: \cite{arxiv:1904.02703,arXiv:2111.03654}

description: |
  Code that utilizes the notion of a lifted product in its construction. Lifted products of certain classical Tanner codes are the first (asymptotically) \textit{good QLDPC codes}.

  A \textit{lifted product over} a ring \(R\) is a product of two chain complexes whose chains are free modules over \(R\). An interesting case is when \(R=\mathbb{F}_q G\), the group-\(G\) algebra over the finite field \({\mathbb{F}}_q = GF(q)\); in this case, the product can be called a \(G\)-\textit{lifted product}. Just like its further generalization the balanced product, a lifted product code generalizes a hypergraph product code in that a reduction of symmetry is exploited to decrease the number of physical qubits required.

  The key operation behind the \(G\)-lifted product is the \(G\)-\textit{lift}. A \(G\)-lift of a \(\mathbb{F}_q\)-valued matrix \(A\) substitutes matrix elements of \(A\) with matrices forming the regular representation of the group algebra \({\mathbb{F}}_q G\) according to some rule. A combination of the lift and the usual hypergraph product yields lifted-product codes. The two operations commute: one can first take the usual hypergraph product of two chain complexes, and then lift the resulting product complex; equivalently, one can take the hypergraph product of the two lifted complexes.

protection: 'Code performance strongly depends on the group \(G\) used in the product \cite{arxiv:2012.04068}.'

features:
  rate: 'There is no known simple way to compute the logical dimension \(k\) in the general case \cite{arxiv:2012.04068}.'

  decoders:
    - BP-OSD decoder \cite{arxiv:1904.02703} adds OSD-like post-processing to the belief propogation (BP) decoder for improved performance.

notes:
  - 'Formerly known as \textit{generalized hypergraph product codes} \cite{arXiv:1904.02703}, and later renamed to lifted-product codes \cite{arXiv:2012.04068,doi:10.1103/PRXQuantum.2.040101}.'

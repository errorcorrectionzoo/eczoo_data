name: 'Lattice subsystem code'

# 1D is not very topological...

description: |
  A geometrically local qubit, modular-qudit, or Galois-qudit subsystem stabilizer code with qudits organized on a lattice modeled by the additive group \(\mathbb{Z}^D\) for spatial dimension \(D\).
  On an infinite lattice, its gauge and stabilizer groups are generated by few-site Pauli operators and their translations, in which case the code is called \textit{translationally invariant subsystem code}.
  Boundary conditions have to be imposed on the lattice in order to obtain finite-dimensional versions, in which case the stabilizer group may no longer be generated by few-site Pauli operators.
  Lattice defects and boundaries between different codes can also be introduced.
  Lattice subsystem stabilizer code Hamiltonians described by an Abelian anyon theory do not always realize the corresponding anyonic topological order in their ground-state subspace and may exhibit a rich phase diagram.

    \begin{defterm}{Subsystem BT bound}
    \label{topic:subsystem-bt-bound}
    Subsystem qubit stabilizer code parameters on \(D\)-dimensional Euclidean lattices are limited by the \textit{subsystem Bravyi-Terhal (BT) bound} \cite{arxiv:0810.1983}, which states that \(d = O(n^{1-1/D})\) and that \(k d^{1/(D-1)} = O(n)\) (using \hyperref[topic:asymptotics]{asymptotic notation}). 
    The second equation is different from the (subspace) \hyperref[topic:bpt-bound]{BPT bound}.
    In particular, \(D=2\)-dimensional subsystem codes satisfy \(kd = O(n)\) \cite{arxiv:1008.1029}.
    More generally, there is a tradeoff theorem \cite{arxiv:1011.3529} stating that, for any logical operator, there is an equivalent logical operator with weight \(\tilde{d}\) such that \(\tilde{d}d^{1/(D-1)}=O(L^{D})\).

       \label{topic:subsystem-bk-bound}
       The \hyperref[topic:bk-bound]{Bravyi-Koenig bound} can be extended to subsystem codes by Pastawski and Yoshida.
       Namely, logical gates implemented via constant-depth quantum circuits on a \(D\)-dimensional lattice subsystem code whose distance increases at least logarithmically with \(n\) lie in the \(D\)th level of the \term{Clifford hierarchy} \cite{arxiv:1408.1720}.

      detail: 'Lattice subsystem codes reduce to lattice stabilizer codes when there are no gauge qudits. The former (latter) is required to admit few-site gauge-group (stabilizer-group) generators on a lattice with boundary conditions.'
    - code_id: topological_abelian
      detail: |
        All 2D Abelian bosonic topological orders can be realized as modular-qudit lattice subsystem codes by starting with an Abelian quantum double model (slightly different from that of Ref. \cite{arxiv:2112.11394}) along with a family of Abelian TQDs that generalize the double semion anyon theory and \hyperref[topic:gauging-out]{gauging out} certain bosonic anyons \cite{arxiv:2211.03798}.
        The stabilizer generators of the new subsystem code may no longer be geometrically local.
        Lattice subsystem stabilizer code Hamiltonians described by an Abelian anyon theory do not always realize the corresponding anyonic topological order in their ground-state subspace and may exhibit a rich phase diagram.
        Non-Abelian topological orders are purported not to be realizable with Pauli stabilizer codes \cite{arxiv:1605.03601}.

description: |
  A geometrically local qubit, modular-qudit, or Galois-qudit subsystem stabilizer code with qudits organized on a lattice modeled by the additive group \(\mathbb{Z}^D\) for spatial dimension \(D\).
  On an infinite lattice, its gauge and stabilizer groups are generated by few-site Pauli operators and their translations, in which case the code is called \textit{translationally invariant subsystem code}.
  Boundary conditions have to be imposed on the lattice in order to obtain finite-dimensional versions, in which case the stabilizer group may no longer be generated by few-site Pauli operators.
  Lattice defects and boundaries between different codes can also be introduced.

    \begin{defterm}{Subsystem BT bound}
    \label{topic:subsystem-BT-bound}
    The subsystem BT bound is an upper bound of \(d = O(L^{D-1})\) on the distance \cite{arXiv:0810.1983} of lattice subsystem stabilizer codes arranged in a \(D\)-dimensional lattice of length \(L\) with \(n=L^D\).
    In particular, \(D=2\)-dimensional subsystem codes satisfy \(kd = O(n)\) \cite{arxiv:1008.1029}.
    More generally, there is a tradeoff theorem \cite{arxiv:1011.3529} stating that, for any logical operator, there is an equivalent logical operator with weight \(\tilde{d}\) such that \(\tilde{d}d^{1/(D-1)}=O(L^{D})\).

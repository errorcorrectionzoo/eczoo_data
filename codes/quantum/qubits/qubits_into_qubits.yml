description: |
  Encodes \(K\)-dimensional Hilbert space into a \(2^n\)-dimensional (i.e., \(n\)-qubit) Hilbert space. Usually denoted as \(((n,K))\) or \(((n,K,d))\), where \(d\) is the code's distance.

  A convenient and often considered error set is the \textit{Pauli error} or \textit{Pauli string} basis. For a single qubit, this set consists of products of powers of the Pauli matrices
  \begin{align}
    X=\begin{pmatrix}0 & 1\\
    1 & 0
    \end{pmatrix}\,\,\text{ and }\,\,Z=\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0\\
    0 & -1
    \end{pmatrix}~.
  \end{align}
  For multiple qubits, error set elements are tensor products of elements of the single-qubit error set.

  The Pauli error set is a unitary and Hermitian basis for linear operators on the multi-qubit Hilbert space that is orthonormal under the Hilbert-Schmidt inner product; it is a prototypical nice error basis \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/9608048}. The distance associated with this set is often the minimum weight of a Pauli string that implements a nontrivial logical operation in the code. The minimum weight of a Pauli error that has a non-zero expectation value for some code basis state is called the \textit{diagonal distance} \cite{arXiv:2107.11286}. Codes whose distance is greater than the diagonal distance are degenerate.

  decoders:
    - 'The decoder determining the most likely error given a noise channel is called the \textit{maximum-likelihood decoder}. For few-qubit codes (\(n\) is small), maximum-likelihood decoding can be based by creating a lookup table. For infinite code families, the size of such a table scales exponentially with \(n\), so approximate decoding algorithms scaling polynomially with \(n\) have to be used.'

notes:
  - 'There is a relation between one-way entanglement distillation protocols and QECCs \cite{arXiv:quant-ph/9604024}.'

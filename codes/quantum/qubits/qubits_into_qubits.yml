code_id: qubits_into_qubits
physical: qubits
logical: qubits

name: 'Qubit code'
#introduced: ''

description: 'Encodes \(K\)-dimensional Hilbert space into a \(2^n\)-dimensional (i.e., \(n\)-qubit) Hilbert space. Usually denoted as \(((n,K))\) or \(((n,K,d))\), where \(d\) is the code''s distance.'

protection: 'The minimum size of a Pauli error that has a non-zero expectation value for some code basis state is called the \textit{diagonal distance} \cite{arXiv:2107.11286}. Codes whose distance is greater than the diagonal distance are degenerate.'

features:
  decoders:
    - 'For few-qubit codes (\(n\) is small), decoding can be based on a lookup table. For infinite code families, the size of such a table scales exponentially with \(n\), so approximate decoding algorithms scaling polynomially with \(n\) have to be used. The decoder determining the most likely error given a noise channel is called the \textit{maximum-likelihood decoder}.'

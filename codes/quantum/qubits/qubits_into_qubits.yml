description: |
  Encodes \(K\)-dimensional Hilbert space into a \(2^n\)-dimensional (i.e., \(n\)-qubit) Hilbert space.
  Usually denoted as \(((n,K))\) or \(((n,K,d))\), where \(d\) is the code's distance.

  The qubit codes are \textit{equivalent} if the codespace of one code can be mapped into that of the other under a tensor product of single-qubit unitary operations and a qubit permutation.

protection: |
  An \(((n,K,d))\) code corrects erasure errors on up to \(d-1\) qubits.
  The number of correctable errors is often called the \textit{decoding radius}, and it is upper bounded by half of the code distance.
  As a result, qubit codes cannot tolerate adversarial errors on more than \((1-R)/4\) registers, where \(R = \log_2 K/n\) is the code rate.

  \subsection{Pauli-string error basis}
  \label{topic:pauli}

  A convenient and often considered error set is the \textit{Pauli error} or \textit{Pauli string} basis.

  \begin{defterm}{Pauli strings}
  For a single qubit, this set consists of products of powers of the Pauli matrices
  \begin{align}
    X=\begin{pmatrix}0 & 1\\
    1 & 0
    \end{pmatrix}\,\,\text{ and }\,\,Z=\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0\\
    0 & -1
    \end{pmatrix}~.
  \end{align}
  For multiple qubits, error set elements are tensor products of elements of the single-qubit error set.
  Tensor products of \(X\) (\(Z\)) Paulis acting on different qubits are called \(X\)\textit{-type} (\(Z\)\textit{-type}) Pauli strings.
  Combining the \(X\)-type and \(Z\)-type strings with \(i\) forms a group called the \textit{Pauli group} on \(n\) qubits, while combining them with \(-1\) forms the \textit{real Pauli group}.
  \end{defterm}

  The Pauli error set is a unitary and Hermitian basis for linear operators on the multi-qubit Hilbert space that is orthonormal under the Hilbert-Schmidt inner product; it is a prototypical \hyperref[topic:nice-error-basis]{nice error basis}.
  The distance associated with this set is often the minimum weight of a Pauli string that implements a nontrivial logical operation in the code.

  \subsection{Noise channels}

  A quantum channel that admits a set of Pauli strings as its Kraus operators is called a \textit{Pauli channel}, and such channels are typically more tractable than the more general, non-Pauli channels.
  Relevant Pauli channels include dephasing noise and depolarizing noise (a.k.a. Werner-Holevo channel \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/0203003}).
  Relevant non-Pauli channels are \hyperref[topic:ad]{AD} noise, erasure (which maps all qubit states into a third state \(|e\rangle\) outside of the qubit Hilbert space), and biased erasure \cite{arxiv:2302.03063} (in which case only the \(|1\rangle\) qubit state is mapped to \(|e\rangle\)).
  Noise can be correlated in space or in time, with the latter being an example of a non-Markovian phenomenon \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/0505153,arxiv:2012.01894}.

  \subsection{Quantum weight enumerators and pure distance}
  \label{topic:quantum-weight-enumerator}

  \begin{defterm}{Quantum weight enumerator}
  Determining protection and bounds on code parameters can also be done using the code's Shor-Laflamme \textit{quantum weight enumerator} \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/9610040} (cf. \hyperref[topic:weight-enumerator]{weight enumerators})
    \begin{align}
    \begin{split}
      A(x)&=\sum_{j=0}^{n}A_{j}x^{j}\\
      A_{j}&=\frac{1}{K^{2}}\sum_{\text{wt-}j\text{ Paulis }P}\left|\text{tr}(P\Pi)\right|^{2}~,
    \end{split}
    \end{align}
  where \(\Pi\) is the code projection, and where the sum is over the Pauli group modulo the subgroup of phases (hence, the dagger below is necessary in case the coset representative is not Hermitian).

  The dual quantum weight enumerator is
    \begin{align}
    \begin{split}
      B(x)&=\sum_{j=0}^{n}B_{j}x^{j}\\
      B_{j}&=\frac{1}{K}\sum_{\text{wt-}j\text{ Paulis }P}\text{tr}(P\Pi P^{\dagger}\Pi)~,
    \end{split}
    \end{align}
  and the two satisfy the \textit{quantum MacWilliams identity} \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/9610040}; see \cite[Ch. 7]{preset:GottesmanBook}.
  This identity gives rise to quantum linear programming (LP) bounds \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/9611001,arxiv:quant-ph/9709049}; see the book \cite{preset:GottesmanBook}.
  Weight enumerators give rise to an analogue of Poisson summation for qubit and, more generally, modular-qudit stabilizer codes \cite{arxiv:2405.19643}.
  \end{defterm}

  \begin{defterm}{Pure distance}
  The distance \(d\) of a qubit code is the smallest integer \(0<j=d\) at which the \hyperref[topic:quantum-weight-enumerator]{quantum weight enumerator} is not equal to its dual, \(A_j \neq B_j\) \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/9906126}.
  A code is called \textit{pure} if \(A_j = 0\) for all \(0 < j < d\); otherwise, the code is called \textit{impure}.
  The \textit{pure distance} \cite{arxiv:1409.2559,arxiv:2107.14252} (a.k.a. diagonal distance \cite{arxiv:0712.1979,arxiv:2107.11286}) \(d_{\textnormal{pure}}\) is the smallest integer \(1 < j=d_{\textnormal{pure}}\) at which \(A_j > 0\).
  Codes for which \(d_{\textnormal{pure}} < d\) are impure, otherwise they are pure.
  For impure codes, there exists a Pauli error of weight less than the \(d\) that has a nonzero expectation value with respect to a code state.

  Degenerate qubit codes are impure, but impure codes may not be degenerate \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/9608006,preset:GottesmanBook}.
  There are subtleties with defining \hyperref[topic:degeneracy]{degeneracy} for non-stabilizer qubit codes with even distance \cite{preset:GottesmanBook}.
  \end{defterm}

  Other types of quantum weight enumerators are the Rains unitary enumerators \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/9612015} and the \textit{Rains shadow enumerators} \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/9611001} (see also \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/0406063}), and \textit{signed weight enumerators} taking into account the sign of the expectation value of a Pauli string \cite{arxiv:1702.06990}. 
  Rains shadow enumerators are related to Bell sampling \cite{arxiv:2408.16914}.
  These notions can be generalized to qudit codes and other error bases \cite{arxiv:0810.2574,doi:10.1016/j.aam.2020.102085,arxiv:2211.02756,arxiv:2308.05152}.
  There are techniques to compute them for general codes \cite{arxiv:2308.05152}.
  Semidefinite programming (SDP) hierarchies and a quantum Delsarte bound have been developed \cite{arxiv:2408.10323}.

# The minimum weight of a Pauli error with nonzero diagonal entries that has a nonzero expectation value for some code basis state is called the \textit{diagonal distance} \cite{arxiv:0712.1979,arxiv:2107.11286} (see also pure distance \cite{arxiv:2107.14252}).
# Codes whose distance is greater than the diagonal distance are \hyperref[topic:degeneracy]{degenerate}.
# \hyperref[topic:degeneracy]{Degenerate} codes admit undetectable Pauli errors (i.e., errors whose projection into the codespace is nonzero) of weight less than the code distance (i.e., the projection satisfies the \term{Knill-Laflamme conditions}).

      \begin{defterm}{Clifford group}
      \label{topic:clifford}
      The Clifford group is the normalizer of the \hyperref[topic:pauli]{Pauli group}. 
      The group consists of the Pauli group as well as elements that permute Pauli operators amongst themselves.
      Up to any phases and Pauli strings, the group is equivalent to the symplectic group \(Sp(2n,\mathbb{Z}_2)\). 
      See Refs. \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/0304125,arxiv:0811.0898,arxiv:1310.6813,arxiv:1810.10259,preset:GottesmanBook} for generators, relations, and normal form. 
      The group cannot be expressed as a semidirect product of the Pauli and symplectic groups \cite{arxiv:2406.09951}.
      Restricting the group to real-valued elements yields the \textit{real Clifford group}, and including complex conjugation yields the \textit{extended Clifford group} \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/0412001}.
      Single-qubit Clifford gates, together with Paulis, realize a group with \(192\) elements.
      Modding out phases yields the \(48\)-element \(2O\) binary octahedral subgroup of \(SU(2)\).
      Further modding out the Pauli group, which corresponds to the quaternion group \(Q\), yields the permutation group \(S_3\), which consists of permutations of the three non-identity single-qubit Pauli matrices.
      The two-qubit Clifford group, modded out by the Pauli group and phases, is isomorphic to \(S_6\), and its subgroups have been classified \cite{arxiv:2409.14624}.
      The irrep structure of the four-fold tensor-product representation has been worked out \cite{arxiv:1609.08172,arxiv:1609.08188}.
      Clifford-group elements can be sampled efficiently \cite{arxiv:1406.2170}.
      \end{defterm}
    - 'Computing using Clifford gates only can be efficiently simulated on a classical computer, according to the \textit{Gottesman-Knill theorem} \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/9807006,manual:{E. Knill, private communication, ca. 1998.}}.
    There is a canonical form for Clifford circuits \cite{arxiv:2003.09412,arxiv:2408.15202} and many algorithms for simulating them \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/0406196,arxiv:1712.03554,arxiv:2301.02356,arxiv:2502.07150}.
    Universal quantum computing can be achieved using Clifford gates and a single type of non-Clifford gate, such as the \(T\) gate \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/9503016}.
    More generally, the \textit{Solovay-Kitaev} theorem \cite{doi:10.1070/rm1997v052n06abeh002155,doi:10.1090/gsm/047} states that any subset of gates the generates a dense subgroup of the full \(n\)-qubit gate group can be used to construct any gate to arbitrary accuracy (see \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/0505030}\cite[Appx. 3]{doi:10.1017/cbo9780511976667.019}). The task of approximating a desired gate by Clifford gates and a fixed set of non-Clifford gates is called \textit{gate compilation} or \textit{circuit synthesis}.'
    - 'Non-Clifford gates are typically more difficult to implement than Clifford gates and so are treated as a resource. Optimizing \(T\)-gate count in circuit synthesis is \(NP\)-hard \cite{arxiv:2310.05958,arxiv:2503.06045} and can be done using various procedures \cite{arxiv:1303.2042,arxiv:1308.4134,arxiv:1601.07363,arxiv:1710.07345,arxiv:1712.01557,arxiv:2110.10292}, e.g., \textit{ZX calculus} (a.k.a. Penrose spin calculus) \cite{arxiv:1903.10477,arxiv:1911.09039,arxiv:2004.05164,arxiv:2109.01076}, reinforcement learning \cite{arxiv:2105.15048,arxiv:2103.07585,arxiv:2212.04508,arxiv:2402.14396,arxiv:2404.14865}, or genetic algorithms \cite{arxiv:2504.09391}.
    There is an optimal asymptotic scaling of the number of T gates needed to prepare an arbitrary state \cite{arxiv:1812.00954,arxiv:2411.04790}.
    Decompositions in terms of Toffoli and Hadamard gates \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/0205115,arxiv:1212.5069} as well as cosine-sine gates also exist \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/0404089}. Gate errors in circuit synthesis can sometimes add up destructively \cite{arxiv:1612.01011}.

      The \(k\)th level is defined recursively by
      \begin{align}

    - 'The decoder determining the most likely error given a noise channel is called the \textit{maximum probability error} (MPE) decoder. For few-qubit codes (\(n\) is small), MPE decoding can be based by creating a lookup table. For infinite code families, the size of such a table scales exponentially with \(n\), so approximate decoding algorithms scaling polynomially with \(n\) have to be used.'
    - '\begin{defterm}{Effective distance and hook errors}
      \label{topic:effective-distance}
      Decoders are characterized by an effective distance (a.k.a. \textit{circuit-level distance}), the minimum number of faulty operations during syndrome measurement that is required to make an undetectable error. A code is \textit{distance-preserving} if it admits a decoder whose circuit-level distance is equal to the code distance. A particularly dangerous class of syndrome measurement circuit faults are \textit{hook errors}, which are ancilla faults that cause more than one data-qubit error \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/0110143}. Hook errors occur at specific places in a syndrome extraction circuit and can sometimes be removed by re-ordering the gates of the circuit. If not, the use of \textit{flag qubits} (see \cite{preset:GottesmanBook}) to detect hook errors may be necessary to yield fault-tolerant decoders.

        \begin{defterm}{Computational threshold}
        \label{topic:computational-threshold}
        A fault-tolerant computational threshold is the maximum noise rate in a particular single-parameter noise model below which any logical computation of size \(M\) can be executed on a physical-qubit architecture to arbitrary accuracy and with an overhead of \hyperref[topic:asymptotics]{order} \(O(M\text{polylog}M)\).
        The first methods to achieve a computational threshold use recursively concatenated stabilizer code families \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/9702058,arxiv:quant-ph/9705031,arxiv:quant-ph/9903099,arxiv:quant-ph/9906129,arxiv:quant-ph/0410047,arxiv:quant-ph/0504218,arxiv:quant-ph/0703230,arxiv:quant-ph/0604090}; such a threshold is called a \textit{concatenated threshold}.
        Initially proven under local stochastic noise, the concatenated threshold theorem also holds for various types of non-Markovian noise \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/0402104,arxiv:quant-ph/0504218,arxiv:quant-ph/0703230,arxiv:quant-ph/0510231} and leakage errors \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/0511065}.
        This theorem can be rephrased in terms of Bernoulli site percolation \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/0307166}.
        The resulting concatenated code is highly \hyperref[topic:degeneracy]{degenerate}, with all but an exponentially small fraction of generators having small weights. 
        Circuit and measurement designs have to take care of the few stabilizer generators with large weights in order to be fault tolerant, but measurement duration may not pose a threat to scalability \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/0607047}.
        Concatenated methods require constant-space and polylogarithmic-time overhead, but concatenations using quantum Hamming codes improve this to quasi-polylogarithmic time \cite{arxiv:2207.08826,arxiv:2402.09606}, and concatenations of the Steane code and certain QLDPC codes further improve this to polylogarithmic time \cite{arxiv:2411.03683}.
        Subsequently, thresholds were determined for infinite families of lattice stabilizer codes, starting with the toric code \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/0110143}; such a threshold is colloquially called a \textit{topological threshold}.
        Fault-tolerant computations with no notion of locality can be made local on a 2D or 3D geometry with minimal overhead \cite{arxiv:2402.13863}.

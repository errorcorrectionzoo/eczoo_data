#description: 'The [[4,2,2]] code is not able to correct arbitrary single-qubit error because \( \lfloor \frac{d-1}{2} \rfloor =0 \). It is more generally used for error detection \cite{arXiv:quant-ph/9603031}, or erasure error correction \cite{arXiv:quant-ph/9610042}. This is also a special case of polar code [source requested].'

realizations:
  # List and explain the different "domains" of realizations in list items.
  # Group closely related realizations into a single item. It's OK to have a
  # single list item. Each item should more or less correspond to what would be
  # said in a paragraph.

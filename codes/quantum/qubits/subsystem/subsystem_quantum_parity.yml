physical: qubits
logical: qubits

name: 'Subsystem QPC'
introduced: '\cite{arXiv:quant-ph/0610088}'

description: |
  Subsystem version of the QPC which has the same parameters as the subspace version, but requires significantly fewer stabilizer measurements, resulting in a much simpler error recovery routine.

  This \([[n_1n_2,k_1k_2,\min(d_1,d_2)]]\) code can be defined \cite{arxiv:0903.0566} via the CSS construction applied to two binary linear codes, \(C_X\) and \(C_Z\), satisfying \(C_X^{\perp}\subset C_Z\).
  These codes are in turn constructed from two more binary linear codes, \(C_1 = [n_1, k_1, d_1]\) and \(C_2 = [n_2, k_2, d_2]\), with parity-check matrices \(H_{1,2}\) and generator matrices \(G_{1,2}\), respectively.
  The parity-check matrices of \(C_X\) and \(C_Z\) are then
  \begin{align}
  \begin{split}
  H_X &= H_1 \otimes I_{n_2}\\
  H_Z &= G_1 \otimes H_2~.
  \end{split}
  \end{align}

  Based on the above construction, the Hilbert space on \(n_1n_2\) qubits can be decomposed into a multiple direct sums of multiple tensor products of Hilbert spaces of lower dimensions, as outlined in \cite{arXiv:quant-ph/0506023}.

# Following the construction outlined in \cite{arXiv:quant-ph/0506023}, this \([[n_1n_2,k_1k_2,\min(d_1,d_2)]]\) code is constructed as follows from two classical linear codes, \(C_1 = [n_1, k_1, d_1]\) and \(C_2 = [n_2, k_2, d_2]\).
# Let \(G_1\) and \(G_2\) (\(H_1\) and \(H_2\)) be the generator (parity-check) matrices for \(C_1\) and \(C_2\), respectively.
# Using the rows of \(H_1\) and \(H_2\), construct stabilizer groups \(\mathsf{S}_{1}=\langle S_{1},\ldots,S_{n_{1}-k_{1}}\rangle\) and \(\mathsf{S}_{2}=\langle T_{1},\ldots,T_{n_{2}-k_{2}}\rangle\), where
# \begin{align}
# \begin{split}
# S_{i}&=\otimes_{j=1}^{n_{1}}Z^{(H_{1})_{ij}}\\
# T_{i}&=\otimes_{j=1}^{n_{2}}X^{(H_{2})_{ij}}~.
# \end{split}
# \end{align}
# Next, consider a square lattice of size \(n \times n\) with a qubit located at each vertex, where \(n = n_1 + n_2\).
# Let \(\mathsf{T}_1\) (\(\mathsf{T}_2\)) be the stabilizer group consisting of \(\mathsf{S}_1\) (\(\mathsf{S}_2\)) operators acting on all columns (rows) of the lattice.
# Then, \(\mathsf{T} = \langle\mathsf{T}_1,\mathsf{T}_2\rangle\) is a nonabelian group from which we can construct an Abelian invariant subgroup \(\mathsf{S}\).
# This subgroup is generated by \(\mathsf{S}_1\) and \(\mathsf{S}_2\) for all stabilizer codeword combinations in both rows and columns.
# By construction, \(\mathsf{S}\) is a stabilizer with \((n_1 - k_1)k_2\) stabilizer generators (i.e., the tensor product of \(I\) and \(Z\) operators), and  \((n_2 - k_2)k_1\) stabilizer generators (i.e., the tensor product of \(I\) and \(X\) operators).

#  It has considerable advantages over the subspace code when it comes to the complexity of error recovery routine, providing a quadratic savings in the number of stabilizers which need to be measured.

#  so that the stabilizer code of \(\mathsf{S}_1\) corrects \(\lfloor\frac{d_1-1}{2}\rfloor\) bit-flip errors, and that of \(\mathsf{S}_2\) corrects \(\lfloor\frac{d_2-1}{2}\rfloor\) phase-flip errors:

#  The logical Pauli group can be constructed using the logical operators of \(\mathsf{S}_1\) and \(\mathsf{S}_2\).

# protection: 'Detecting single-qubit errors of weight up to \(\min(d_1,d_2)\).'

features:
  decoders:
    - 'In a \([[n_1n_2, k_1k_2, min(d_1, d_2)]]\) QPC, error correction is achieved by measuring \((n_1−k_1)n_2+(n_2−k_2)\) stabilizer generators \cite{arXiv:quant-ph/0508131}. The subsystem QPC achieves the same degree of correctability, but requires only \((n_1−k_1)k_2+k_1(n_2−k_2)\) stabilizer measurements.'

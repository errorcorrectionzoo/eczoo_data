name: 'Heavy-hexagon code'
introduced: '\cite{arxiv:1907.09528}'

description: |
  Subsystem stabilizer code on the heavy-hexagonal point set that combines Bacon-Shor and surface-code stabilizers.
  Encodes one logical qubit into \(n=(5d^2-2d-1)/2\) physical qubits with distance \(d\).
  The heavy-hexagonal point set allows for low degree (at most 3) connectivity between all the data and ancilla qubits, which is suitable for fixed-frequency transom qubits subject to frequency collision errors.
  The code can be split into a surface and a Bacon-Shor code, with the idling qubits of one code serving as the physical qubits of the other \cite{arxiv:2404.15989}.

  Data qubits and ancillas of the code are placed on a heavy-hexagonal point set (vertices and edges of a tilling of hexagons). A subset of the ancilla qubits are flag qubits used for detecting high-weight errors arising from fewer faults. The code stabilizers for detecting \(X\)-type errors are measured by measuring weight-two \(Z\)-type gauge operators whose product produces stabilizers of the surface code. \(X\)-type stabilizers are column operators corresponding to stabilizers of the Bacon-Shor code, which are measured by taking products of weight-four and weight-two \(X\)-type gauge operators.


protection: 'Protects against Pauli noise. The code has no threshold for \(Z\)-type Pauli errors since they are detected by Bacon-Shor-type stabilizers.'

features:
  rate: '\(1/n\) for a distance-\(d\) heavy-hexagon code on \(n = (5d^2-2d-1)/2\) qubits.'

  encoders:
    - 'For a logical-zero state, prepare all data qubits in the physical-zero state and then measure the \(X\)-type Bacon-Shor stabilizers. For logical-plus state, prepare all data qubits in the physical-plus state and then measure \(Z\)-type surface code stabilizers.'
    - 'Stabilizer measurement encoding circuits have a constant depth of 10 time steps (excluding ancilla state preparation and measurement).'

  transversal_gates:
    - 'CNOT gates are transveral for this code. However, for most architectures, all logical gates would be implemented using lattice surgery methods.'

  general_gates:
    - 'Universal gate set achieved with magic state injection and lattice surgery.'
    - 'Magic-state injection with and without flag qubits \cite{arxiv:2412.15751}.'

  decoders:
    - 'Any graph-based decoder can be used, such as MWPM and Union Find. However, edge weights must be dynamically renormalized using flag-qubit measurement outcomes after each syndrome measurement round.'
    - 'Machine-learning \cite{arxiv:2210.09730} and neural-network \cite{arxiv:2311.15146} decoders.'



  fault_tolerance:
    - 'All logical gates can be fault-tolerantly implemented using lattice surgery and magic state injection.'
    - 'Stabilizer measurements are measured fault-tolerantly using one-flag circuits since some single-fault events can result in weight-two data qubit errors which are parallel to the code''s logical operators. Hence, using information from the flag-qubit measurements is crucial to fault-tolerantly measure the code stabilizers.'

  threshold:
    - '\(0.45\%\) for \(X\) errors under a full circuit-level depolarizing noise model (obtained from Monte Carlo simulations).'
    - '\(Z\)-errors have no threshold given the \(X\)-type Bacon-Shor stabilizers.'

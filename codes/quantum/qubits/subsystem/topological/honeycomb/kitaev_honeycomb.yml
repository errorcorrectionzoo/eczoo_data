logical: qubits

name: 'Kitaev honeycomb code'
introduced: '\cite{arxiv:cond-mat/0506438,arxiv:1012.0425,arxiv:1701.05052}'

description: |
  Code whose logical subspace is labeled by different fusion outcomes of Ising anyons present in the Ising-anyon topological phase of the Kitaev honeycomb model \cite{arxiv:cond-mat/0506438}.
  Ising anyons also exist in other phases, such as the fractional quantum Hall phase \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/0511178}.

  The Kitaev honeycomb model can be formulated as a qubit subsystem stabilizer code based on the \(\mathbb{Z}_2^{(1)}\) Abelian anyon theory, which is non-chiral and non-modular \cite[Sec. 7.3]{arxiv:2211.03798}.
  The model realizes all anyon theories of the 16-fold way, i.e., all minimal modular extensions of the \(\mathbb{Z}_2^{(1)}\) anyon theory \cite{arxiv:cond-mat/0506438}\cite[Footnote 25]{arxiv:2211.03798}.
  This includes the (non-Abelian) Ising-anyon topological order \cite{arxiv:cond-mat/0506438} (a.k.a. \(p+ip\) superconducting phase \cite{arxiv:1104.5485}) as well as Abelian \(\mathbb{Z}_2\) topological order.
  As a subsystem code, however, the Kitaev honeycomb model does not encode any logical qubits \cite{arxiv:1012.0425}.

      detail: |
        Embedding each physical qubit into two fermions via the tetron code is useful for exactly solving the Kitaev honeycomb model Hamiltonian \cite{arxiv:cond-mat/0506438} and other qubit Hamiltonians on certain graphs \cite{arxiv:2003.05465,arxiv:2012.07857}.
        It also allows the logical subspace of the Kitaev honeycomb model to be formulated as a joint eigenspace of certain Majorana operators \cite[Sec. 4.1]{arxiv:1701.05052}, which admit braiding-based gates due to their non-Abelian statistics and which can be used for topological quantum computation.
        When done in reverse, this embedding can be thought of as a 2D bosonization fermion-into-qubit encoding by converting to a relabeled square lattice and performing single-qubit rotations \cite{arxiv:1711.00515}\cite[Sec. IV.B]{arxiv:2201.05153}.

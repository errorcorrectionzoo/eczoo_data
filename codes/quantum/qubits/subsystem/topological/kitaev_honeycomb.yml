code_id: kitaev_honeycomb
physical: qubits
logical: qubits

name: 'Kitaev honeycomb code'
introduced: '\cite{arxiv:cond-mat/0506438,arxiv:1701.05052}'

description: |
  Code whose logical subspace is labeled by different fusion outcomes of Ising anyons present in the nonabelian topological phase of the Kitaev honeycomb model \cite{arXiv:cond-mat/0506438}.
  Each logical qubit is constructed out of four Majorana operators, which admit braiding-based gates due to their nonabelian statistics and which can be used for topological quantum computation.

  The Kitaev honeycomb model can be formulated as a qubit subsystem stabilizer code based on the \(\mathbb{Z}_2^{(1)}\) abelian anyon theory, which is non-chiral and non-modular \cite[Sec. 7.3]{arxiv:2211.03798}.
  The model realizes all anyon theories of the 16-fold way, i.e., all minimal modular extensions of the \(\mathbb{Z}_2^{(1)}\) anyon theory \cite{arxiv:cond-mat/0506438}\cite[Footnote 25]{arXiv:2211.03798}.

  The Kitaev honeycomb code utilizes the nonabelian Ising-anyon topological order of the Kitaev honeycomb model \cite{arXiv:cond-mat/0506438} (a.k.a. \(p+ip\) superconducting phase \cite{arxiv:1104.5485}) as well as abelian \(\mathbb{Z}_2\) topological order.
  More generally, the Hamiltonian realizes all anyon theories of the 16-fold way, i.e., all minimal modular extensions of the \(\mathbb{Z}_2^{(1)}\) abelian non-chiral non-modular anyon theory \cite{arxiv:cond-mat/0506438}\cite[Footnote 25]{arXiv:2211.03798}.

      detail: 'While the Kitaev honeycomb model is bosonic, a fermionic mapping is useful for solving and understanding the model. Logical subspace of the Kitaev honeycomb code can be formulated as a joint eigenspace of certain Majorana operators \cite[Sec. 4.1]{arxiv:1701.05052}. Logical Paulis are also be constructed out of Majorana operators.'

    - code_id: surface
      detail: 'The Kitaev honeycomb model can be formulated as a qubit subsystem stabilizer code.
      This code can be obtained from the square-lattice surface code by \hyperref[topic:gauging-out]{gauging out} the anyon \(em\) \cite[Sec. 7.3]{arxiv:2211.03798}.
      During this process, the square lattice is effectively expanded to a hexagonal lattice \cite[Fig. 12]{arxiv:2211.03798}.'

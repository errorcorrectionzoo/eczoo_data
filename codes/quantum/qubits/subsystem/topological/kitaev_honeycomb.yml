logical: qubits

name: 'Kitaev honeycomb code'
introduced: '\cite{arxiv:cond-mat/0506438,arxiv:1012.0425,arxiv:1701.05052}'

description: |
  Code whose logical subspace is labeled by different fusion outcomes of Ising anyons present in the Ising-anyon topological phase of the Kitaev honeycomb model \cite{arxiv:cond-mat/0506438}.
  Each logical qubit is constructed out of four Majorana operators, which admit braiding-based gates due to their non-Abelian statistics and which can be used for topological quantum computation.
  Ising anyons also exist in other phases, such as the fractional quantum Hall phase \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/0511178}.

  The Kitaev honeycomb model can be formulated as a qubit subsystem stabilizer code based on the \(\mathbb{Z}_2^{(1)}\) Abelian anyon theory, which is non-chiral and non-modular \cite[Sec. 7.3]{arxiv:2211.03798}.
  The model realizes all anyon theories of the 16-fold way, i.e., all minimal modular extensions of the \(\mathbb{Z}_2^{(1)}\) anyon theory \cite{arxiv:cond-mat/0506438}\cite[Footnote 25]{arxiv:2211.03798}.
  This includes the (non-Abelian) Ising-anyon topological order \cite{arxiv:cond-mat/0506438} (a.k.a. \(p+ip\) superconducting phase \cite{arxiv:1104.5485}) as well as Abelian \(\mathbb{Z}_2\) topological order.
  As a subsystem code, however, the Kitaev honeycomb model does not encode any logical qubits \cite{arxiv:1012.0425}.

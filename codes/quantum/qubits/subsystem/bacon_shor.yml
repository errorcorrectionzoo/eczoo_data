description: |
  CSS subsystem stabilizer code defined on an \(m_1 \times m_2\) lattice of qubits. It is said to be symmetric when \(m_1=m_2\). The \(X\)-type and \(Z\)-type stabilizers defined as \(X\) and \(Z\) operators acting on all qubits on adjacent columns and rows, respectively. Let \(O_{i,j}\) denote an operator acting on the qubit at a position \((i,j)\) on the lattice, with \(i\in\{0,1,\ldots ,m_1-1\}\) and \(j\in\{0,1,\ldots,m_2-1\}\). The code's stabilizer group is
  \begin{align}
  \mathsf{S}=\langle X_{i,*}X_{i+1,*},Z_{*,j}Z_{*,j+1}\rangle~,
  \end{align}
  with generators expressed as products of nearest-neightbour 2-qubit gauge operators,
  \begin{align}
  \begin{split}
  X_{i,*}X_{i+1,*}= \bigotimes_{k=0}^{m_2-1} X_{i,k}X_{i+1,k} \\
  Z_{*,j}Z_{*,j+1}=\bigotimes_{k=0}^{m_1-1} Z_{k,j}Z_{k,j+1}~.
  \end{split}
  \end{align}
  Syndrome extraction can be done by measuring these gauge operators, which are on fewer qubits and local.

  The shortest error-correcting Bacon-Shor code is \([[9,1,3]]\) and has 6 gauge operators, symmetric in both \(X\) and \(Z\), reducing to the \hyperref[code:shor_nine]{Shor code} for a particular gauge configuration. The error-detecting \([[4,1,2]]\) Bacon-Shor code, which reduces to a subcode of the \hyperref[code:stab_4_2_2]{\([[4,2,2]]\) code} for a particular gauge configuration, has gauge operators \(\{XIXI,IIXX,ZIZI,IZIZ\}\).

protection: 'The \([[m_1 m_2,1,min(m_1,m_2)]]\) variant has distance \(d=min(m_1,m_2)\). In a symmetric 3-dimensional case (defined on a cubic lattice) with \(L^3\) qubits, the code has the parameters \([[L^3,1,L]]\).'

features:
  rate: 'A non-LDPC family of Bacon-Shor codes achieves a distance of \(\Omega(n^{1-\epsilon})\) with sparse gauge operators.'
  transversal_gates: 'Logical Hadamard is transversal in symmetric Bacon-Shor codes up to a qubit permutation \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/0610063} and can be implemented with teleportation \cite{arXiv:quant-ph/0002039}. Bacon-Shor codes on an \(m \times mk\) lattice admit transversal \(k\)-qubit-controlled \(Z\) gates \cite{arXiv:1705.01686}.'
  general_gates:
  - 'Piecably fault-tolerant circuits can be employed to construct non-transversal gates effectively \cite{manual:{Yoder, Theodore., \emph{DSpace@MIT} Practical Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computation (2018)}}.'
  fault_tolerance:
  - 'Piecably fault-tolerant circuits can be employed to construct non-transversal gates effectively \cite{manual:{Yoder, Theodore., \emph{DSpace@MIT} Practical Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computation (2018)}}.'
  threshold:
  - 'A lower bound of \(1.94 \times 10^{-4}\) for the accuracy threshold was proved for Bacon-Shor code with 5 levels of concatenation, using Steane method of FTEC \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/0610063}.'
  - 'The three dimensional version offers the possibility of being a self-correcting quantum memory \cite{doi:10.1103/PhysRevA.73.012340}.'
  decoders:
  - 'While check operators are few-body, stabilizer weights scale with the number of qubits, and stabilizer expectation values are obtained by taking products of gauge-operator expectation values. It is thus not clear how to extract stabilizer values in a fault-tolerant manner \cite{arxiv:2009.03921,arXiv:2107.02194}.'

realizations:
  - 'Trapped-ion qubits: state preparation, logical measurement, and stabilizer measurement for nine-qubit Bacon-Shor code demonstrated on a 13-qubit device by M. Cetina and C. Monroe groups \cite{arxiv:2009.11482}.'

description: 'It is a constructive map from an arbitrary stabilizer code into a new subsystem code, with the same distance and number of encoded qubits. All generators have constant weight, at the cost of additional physical qubits. The construction involves the quantum error detecting circuit of the original code. Given such a circuit, there is a qubit corresponding to every output and input of each circuit element, and a set of gauge generators corresponding to each circuit element. Thus, the number of physical qubits of the new code is of the order of the number of circuit elements in the circuit. If w is the largest arity of a gate in V, then each gauge generator in the code has weight at most \(w + 1\) and each qubit is measured by \(\leq 2w + 2\) gauge generators. Further, the new code can be made geometrically local at the cost of more ancilla qubits. This construction is used to show the existance of spatially local subsysem codes that nearly saturate the upper bound, \(d\leq O(n^{1-1/D})\) set by Bravyi and Terhal \cite{arXiv:0810.1983}. It also shows the existance of quantum error correcting subsystem codes with gauge generators of weight O(1), minimum distance \(d = n^{1-\epsilon}\) where \(\epsilon = O(1/\sqrt{\log n})\)'

  rate: 'Given any \([n_0,k_0,d_0]\) quantum stabilizer code, the construction outputs a \([n = O(\sum_i w_i),k=k_0,d=d_0]\) quantum subsystem code, with gauge generators of weight \(w_1,..., w_i,...,w_{n_0-k_0}\) such that \(w_i\) is \(O(1)\).'

    - 'A new fault-tolerant measurement gadget that is a modification based on the DiVincenzo-Shor cat-state method \cite{arXiv:quant-ph/9605011,	arXiv:quant-ph/9605031}.'
  threshold:
    - 'Possible improvement of error threshold because it is a sparse code (It is not clear a priori because there are more checks to be measured.).'

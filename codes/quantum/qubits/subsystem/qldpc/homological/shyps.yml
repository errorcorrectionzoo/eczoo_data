name: 'Subsystem Hypergraph Product Simplex (SHYPS) code'
short_name: 'SHYPS'
introduced: '\cite{arxiv:2502.07150}'

description: |
    Family of quantum LDPC codes obtained by combining the \hyperref[code:subsystem_quantum_parity]{subsystem hypgergraph product code} construction with classical \hyperref[code:simplex]{simplex codes}. 
    The result are CSS subsystem codes with weight-three gauge generators and code parameters \([n=(2^r − 1)^2, k=r^2, d=2^{r-1}]\) for \(r \geq 3\).

    Due to their symmetric structure, SHYPS codes inherit the large authomorphism group of the underlying classical simplex codes. 
    More precisely, \(|Aut(SHYPS(r))| \geq |GL_{r}(\mathbb{F}_2)|^2\), which is exponential in the number of logical qubits. 
    This large authomorphism group can be leveraged to obtain a depth-one fault-tolerant implementation for a large set of logical Clifford operators. 
    This set of depth-one Clifford generators is sufficiently large to allow for efficient compilation, i.e., any \(m\)-qubit Clifford operator can be executed in depth of \hyperref[topic:asymptotics]{order} \(O(m)\). 
    Due to single-shot properties of SHYPS codes, only \hyperref[topic:asymptotics]{order} \(O(m)\) rounds of syndrome extraction are required to fault-tolerantly execute any logical \(m\)-qubit \hyperref[topic:clifford]{Clifford circuit}.


protection: |
  Simulations of logical \hyperref[topic:clifford]{Clifford gates} on two code blocks of the \([[49, 9, 4]]\) SHYPS code show a \(0.018\%\) pseudo-threshold under circuit-level noise with a BP-OSD decoder \cite{arxiv:2502.07150}.
  Memory simulations of the \([[49, 9, 4]]\) and \([[225, 16, 8]]\) SHYPS codes under circuit-level noise with a sliding window decoder using BPOSD were also performed in \cite{arxiv:2502.07150}.

logical: qubits

name: 'Bacon-Shor code'
introduced: '\cite{doi:10.1103/PhysRevA.52.R2493,arxiv:quant-ph/0305025,arxiv:quant-ph/0506023}'

description: |
  Subsystem CSS code defined on an \(m_1 \times m_2\) lattice of qubits that generalizes the \([[9,1,3]]\) (subspace) Shor code.
  It is said to be \textit{symmetric} when \(m_1=m_2\), and \textit{asymmetric} otherwise.

  The \(X\)-type and \(Z\)-type stabilizers defined as \(X\) and \(Z\) operators acting on all qubits on adjacent columns and rows, respectively. Let \(O_{i,j}\) denote an operator acting on the qubit at a position \((i,j)\) on the lattice, with \(i\in\{0,1,\ldots ,m_1-1\}\) and \(j\in\{0,1,\ldots,m_2-1\}\). The code's stabilizer group is
  \begin{align}
  \mathsf{S}=\langle X_{i,*}X_{i+1,*},Z_{*,j}Z_{*,j+1}\rangle~,
  \end{align}
  with generators expressed as products of nearest-neightbour 2-qubit gauge operators,
  \begin{align}
  \begin{split}
  X_{i,*}X_{i+1,*}= \bigotimes_{k=0}^{m_2-1} X_{i,k}X_{i+1,k} \\
  Z_{*,j}Z_{*,j+1}=\bigotimes_{k=0}^{m_1-1} Z_{k,j}Z_{k,j+1}~.
  \end{split}
  \end{align}
  Syndrome extraction can be done by measuring these gauge operators, which are on fewer qubits and local.

  A Floquet version of the Bacon-Shor code admits a period-four measurement sequence that utilizes its gauge degrees of freedom as defects evolving across measurement rounds. This \textit{Floquet-Bacon-Shor} code saturates the \hyperref[topic:subsystem-bt-bound]{subsystem BT bound}.
  Applying a period-four measurement schedule to the original Bacon-Shor code yields a numerical threshold under circuit-level noise \cite{arxiv:2504.02749}.

protection: |
  The \([[m_1 m_2,1,min(m_1,m_2)]]\) variant has distance \(d=min(m_1,m_2)\).
  In a symmetric 3-dimensional case (defined on a cubic lattice) with \(L^3\) qubits, the code has the parameters \([[L^3,1,L]]\).
  Bacon-Shor code parameteres can be optimized by changing the block geometry, yielding good performance against biased noise \cite{arxiv:1209.0794}.

    - 'The number of check operators scales sublinearly with system size, so the Bacon-Shor codes alone do not exhibit a topological threshold in the \(m_1,m_2 \to \infty\) limit \cite{arxiv:1903.03937}.
    However, a threshold can be obtained from concatenated Bacon-Shor codes that are further restricted to planar geometries, whose recovery circuit is a subset of a circuit used by a larger bona-fide Bacon-Shor code \cite{arxiv:2305.12046}.
    This threshold differs from a \hyperref[topic:computational-threshold]{concatenated threshold} in that there are no long-range connectivity requirements.'

    - 'While check operators are few-body, stabilizer weights scale with the number of qubits, and stabilizer expectation values are obtained by taking products of gauge-operator expectation values.

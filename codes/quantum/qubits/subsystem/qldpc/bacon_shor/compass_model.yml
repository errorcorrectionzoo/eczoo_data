name: 'Compass code'
introduced: '\cite{arxiv:1809.01193}'

description: |
  Subspace or subsystem CSS code defined by gauge-fixing the Bacon-Shor code, i.e., the code whose gauge group consists of terms in the compass model Hamiltonian \cite{doi:10.1070/PU1982v025n04ABEH004537,arxiv:cond-mat/0501708,arxiv:1303.5922} on a square lattice.
  Families of random codes perform well against biased noise and spatially dependent (i.e., asymmetric) noise.

  The gauge fixing proceeds by denoting plaquettes by \(X\) or \(Z\) type using two colors, and fixing or \textit{cutting} the corresponding \(X\) or \(Z\)-type gauge generators at the respective plaquettes.
  A fully colored lattice yields a subspace code, but allowing for non-colored plaquettes yield a subsystem code.
  A fully non-colored lattice reduces to the Bacon-Shor code.

  The \textit{surface-density} compass code family is obtained by randomly cutting \(X\)-type stabilizers at only plaquettes of one color in a checkboard coloring; it interpolates between Bacon-Shor codes and rotated surface codes.
  The \textit{Shor-density} compass code family is obtained by randomly cutting \(X\)-type stabiilzers at any plaquette; it interpolates between Bacon-Shor codes and QPCs.

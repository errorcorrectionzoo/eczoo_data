code_id: binary_dihedral_permutation_invariant
physical: qubits
logical: qubits

name: 'Binary dihedral PI code'
introduced: '\cite{arxiv:2310.17652}'

description: |
  Multi-qubit PI code designed to realize gates from the binary dihedral group transversally.
  Can also be interpreted as a single-spin code.
  The codespace projection is a projection onto an irrep of the \textit{binary dihedral group} \( \mathsf{BD}_{2N} = \langle\omega I, X, P\rangle \) of order \(8N\), where \( \omega \) is a \( 2N \)th root of unity, and \( P = \text{diag} ( 1, \omega^2) \).

  The construction includes three families and a handful of particular codes.
  The first family has parameters \(((2m+3,2,3))\) for \(m\) not a power of two, realizing binary dihedral transversal gates that are not possible to realize in any qubit stabilizer code \cite[Prop. 1]{arxiv:2310.17652}.
  The second family is the case of \(m\) being a power of two, corresponding to \(((2^{m-1}+3,2,3))\) codes, each realizing a member of the \term{Clifford hierarchy} transversally.
  The third family consists of \(((n,2,d))\) codes with \(n = \frac{1}{4}(3d^2+6d-7+2(d\text{ mod }8))\), realizing \(S\) and \(T\) gates transversally.
  The handful of codes have distance 5 (7, 9, 11, 13) and encode in 27 (49, 73, 107, 147) qubits, all realizing transversal \(T\) gates.

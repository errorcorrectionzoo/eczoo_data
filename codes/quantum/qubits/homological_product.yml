code_id: homological_product
physical: qubits
logical: qubits

name: 'Homological product code'
introduced: '\cite{arXiv:1311.0885}'

description: 'Stub.'
# Could be expanded to include Tanner graphs
# Defn of CSS has been changed to accomodate this... In contrast to the original CSS construction there are no restrictions on the form of \(C_1\) and \(C_2\).'

protection: ''

features:
  fault_tolerance:
    - 'Universal set of gates can be obtained by fault-tolerantly mapping between different encoded representations of a given logical state \cite{arXiv:1807.09783}.'

  decoders:
    - 'Union-find \cite{arXiv:2009.14226}.'

#notes:
# VVA: Added already as cousin entry. - 'The surface code can be constructed form the hypergraph product of two repetition codes. Similarily, the toric code is obtained from the hypergraph product of two closed-loop repetition codes.'

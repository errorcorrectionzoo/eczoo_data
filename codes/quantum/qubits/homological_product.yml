name: 'Single-sector Homological product code'
introduced: '\cite{arXiv:1311.0885}'

description: |
        'In the single sector homological product code, each base code is associated with the chain complex \( C_a \longrightarrow C_a\longrightarrow C_a\) 
                     such that the boundary operator satisfies \(\partial_{a}^{2}=0\). The image \(im\partial\) form the parity check space and any set of basis for this 
                     space can be viewed as Z-type stabilizer group generators. The same rule holds for \(im\partial^{T}\), which gives X-type stabilizer generators. 
                     Conversely, \(ker\partial\setminus im\partial\) 
                     (or \(\partial^{T}\)) correspond to all undetectable errors of Z-type(X-type). Finally, the Z-type logical operators are just elements in the
                     homological group \(ker\partial/im\partial\) and X-type logical operators are just elements in the
                     cohomological group \(ker\partial^{T}/im\partial^{T}\).\\
                     For two chain complexes, the product complex is 
                     \( C_1\otimes C_2 \longrightarrow C_1\otimes C_2\longrightarrow C_1\otimes C_2\).  
                     The boundary operator is now \(\partial_1\otimes I_2+I_1\otimes \partial_2\).\\
                     For simplicity, the paper \cite{arXiv:1311.0885} used two codes with the same \(n,k\). The boundary operator \(\delta_1\) and \(\delta_2\) 
                     are selected from a random ensemble of boundary operators, with uniform probability distribution. To be precise, the boundary operator
                     \(\delta_a\) can be represented by the form \(\delta_a=U_a \delta_0 U_a^{-1}\) where \(U_a\) is a random \(n\times n\) invertible matrix 
                     selected from all possible invertible matrices with uniform distribution and \(\delta_0\) is the canonical form \cite{arXiv:1311.0885}.'
# Could be expanded to include Tanner graphs
# Defn of CSS has been changed to accomodate this... In contrast to the original CSS construction there are no restrictions on the form of \(C_1\) and \(C_2\).'

features:
  rate:
    -'Given two codes \([[n_a, k_a, d_a, w_a]]\) where \(w_a\) denotes the maximum hamming weight of all rows and columns of \(\partial_a\), the homological product code has parameter \([[n=n_1 n_2, k=k_1 k_2, d\leq d_1 d_2, w\leq w_1+w_2]]\).'
    -'From this formula, and the fact that a randomly selected boundary operator \(\partial\) yields a CSS code that is good with high probability, we see that the product code has \(k=\Theta(n)\) and \(w=O(\sqrtr{n})\) with high probability.'
    -'The main result in \cite{arXiv:1311.0885} is to show that the product code actually has linear distance with high probability as well.'
    -'To sum up, it is shown that we have a family of \([[n,k=c_1 n, d=c_2 n, w=c_3 \sqrt{n}]]\) codes given small enough \(c_1,c_2,c_3\).'

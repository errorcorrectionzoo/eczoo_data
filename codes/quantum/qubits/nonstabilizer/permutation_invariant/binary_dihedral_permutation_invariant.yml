code_id: binary_dihedral_permutation_invariant
physical: qubits
logical: qubits

name: 'Binary dihedral permutation-invariant code'
introduced: '\cite{arxiv:2310.17652}'

description: |
  Multi-qubit code designed to realize gates from the binary dihedral group transversally.
  Can also be interpreted as a single-spin code.
  The codespace projection is a projection onto an irrep of the \textit{binary dihedral group} \( \mathsf{BD}_{2N} = \{\omega I, X, P\} \) of order \(8N\), where \( \omega \) is a \( 2N \)th root of unity, and \( P = \text{diag} ( 1, \omega^2) \).

  The construction includes three families.
  The first family has parameters \(((2m+3,2,3))\) for \(m\) not a power of two, realizing binary dihedral transversal gates that are not possible to realize in any qubit stabilizer code \cite[Prop. 1]{arxiv:2310.17652}.
  The second family is the case of \(m\) being a power of two, corresponding to \(((2^{r-1}+3,2,3))\) codes, each realizing a member of the Clifford hierarchy transversally.
  The third family consists of \(((n,2,d))\) codes with \(n = \frac{1}{4}(3d^2+6d-7+2(d\text{ mod }8))\), realizing \(S\) and \(T\) gates transversally.

features:
  transversal_gates: 'Binary dihedral group gates can be realized transversally, which include subsgroups of any level of the Clifford hierarchy and subgroups which cannot be realized by any qubit stabilizer code.'

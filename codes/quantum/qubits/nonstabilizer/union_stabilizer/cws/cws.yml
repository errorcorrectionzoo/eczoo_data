name: 'Codeword stabilized (CWS) code'
short_name: 'CWS'
introduced: '\cite{arxiv:cs/0610159,arxiv:0708.1021}'

description: |
  A code defined using a cluster state and a set of \(Z\)-type Pauli strings defined by a binary classical code.

  The CWS construction takes in \( \mathcal{Q} = (\mathcal{G},\mathcal{C}) \), where \(\mathcal{G}\) is a graph, and where \(\mathcal{C}\) is an \((n,K,d)\) binary code.
  From the graph, we form the unique cluster state \( |\mathcal{G} \rangle \).
  From the binary code, we form Pauli \(Z\)-type operators \( W_i = Z^{c_{i,1}} \otimes \cdots \otimes Z^{c_{i,n}} \), where \(c_{i,j} \) is the \(j\)-th coordinate of the \(i\)-th classical codeword.
  The CWS codewords are then \( | i \rangle =  W_i | \mathcal{G} \rangle \).

  The above definition corresponds to the \textit{standard form} of CWS codes.
  Since any stabilizer state is equivalent to a cluster state under a single-qubit \hyperref[topic:clifford]{Clifford circuit} \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/0308151}\cite[Appx. A]{arxiv:1910.00471}, any code whose underlying state is a non-cluster stabilizer state is similarly equivalent to a CWS code.

  The term CWS was coined in Ref. \cite{arxiv:0708.1021}, and their approach is equivalent to another approach \cite{arxiv:cs/0610159} based on Boolean functions (see Ref. \cite{manual:{Zeng, Bei. Quantum operations and codes beyond the Stabilizer-Clifford framework. Diss. Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 2009.}}).
  In an alternative convention (not used here), CWS codes are defined from an underlying stabilizer state that is not a necessarily a cluster state.


protection: |
  Code distance \(\mathcal{Q} = ( \mathcal{G},\mathcal{C}) \) is upper bounded by the distance of the classical code \(\mathcal{C} \).
  A CWS code is degenerate if and only if it is \hyperref[topic:quantum-weight-enumerator]{impure} \cite{arxiv:0912.3245}.
  The \hyperref[topic:quantum-weight-enumerator]{pure distance} is upper bounded by \(\delta + 1\), where \(\delta\) is the minimum degree of \(\mathcal{G}\) \cite{arxiv:0712.1979,arxiv:2107.11286}.
  Some bounds on the distance are provided in Ref. \cite{arxiv:1108.5490}.

      detail: 'Any CWS code can be written as a USt whose (\(K=1\)) stabilizer code is the cluster state and whose coset representatives are constructed from the binary classical code.
      Conversely, USt codes are equivalent to CWS codes via a single-qubit \hyperref[topic:clifford]{Clifford circuit} as follows \cite{arxiv:0907.2038,manual:{Li, Yunfan. Codeword Stabilized Quantum Codes and Their Error Correction. Diss. UC Riverside, 2010.}}\cite[Sec. 10.4]{doi:10.1017/CBO9781139034807.012}.
      The set of coset representatives of any USt can be extended to a larger set iterating over the underlying stabilizer code such that all codewords can be obtained from a single stabilizer state.
      Then, one can apply a single-qubit Clifford transformation to map said stabilizer state into a cluster state.'

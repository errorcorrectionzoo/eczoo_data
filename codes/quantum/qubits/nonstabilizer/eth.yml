description: |
  An \(n\)-qubit approximate code whose codespace is formed by eigenstates of a translationally-invariant quantum many-body system which satisfies the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH).
  ETH ensures that codewords cannot be locally distinguished in the thermodynamic limit.
  Relevant many-body systems include 1D non-interacting spin chains or frustration-free systems such as Motzkin chains and Heisenberg models.

  ETH requires that for ordered energy eigenstates \(|E_l\rangle\) and any local observable \(O\),
  \begin{align}
  |\langle E_l|O|E_l\rangle-\langle E_{l+1}|O|E_{l+1}\rangle|\leq\exp(-cn)
  \end{align}
  for a constant \(c\).
  This implies that energy eigenstates around some energy \(\bar E\) are approximately locally indistinguishable from one another, as their reduced density matrices on any subsystem are both approximately thermal at energy \(\bar E\).
  In this way, global information is protected from local measurements by the environment as \(n\to\infty\).

protection: |
  Approximately protects against erasure errors at known locations. Translation invariance alone is sufficient for good approximate error-correcting properties in a many-body spectrum, including in integrable models \cite{arxiv:1710.04631}. The ETH code generated from the spectrum of the translation-invariant 1D Heisenberg spin chain \cite{arxiv:1710.04631} has recovery infidelity (against the erasure of a constant number of sites) scale as \(\epsilon_\text{worst}=O(1/n)\) \cite{arxiv:1902.07714}.'

  The ETH code defined on a Heisenberg spin chain has unbouldable \hyperref[topic:codespace-complexity]{codespace complexity} \cite{arxiv:2310.04710}.

name: 'Hexagonal \(CZ\) code'
introduced: '\cite{arxiv:1508.03468}'

description: |
  A cubic theory code defined on a hexagonal lattice in 2D.
  Its stabilizers are products of Pauli-\(Z\) operators and \(CZ\) gates \cite[Fig. 6]{arxiv:1508.03468}\cite[Fig. 3]{arxiv:2503.15751}.
  The ground-state subspace of the hexagonal \(CZ\) code realizes the topological order of the \(G=\mathbb{Z}^3_2\) TQD model \cite{arxiv:1508.03468,arxiv:2405.11719}, which is the same topological order as the \(G=D_4\) quantum double \cite{arxiv:hep-th/9511195,arxiv:2112.12757}.
  The stabilizers include \(CZ\) operators acting on hexagonal loops, but a reduced version exists where only two \(CZ\) gates act on each loop \cite{arxiv:2503.15751}.

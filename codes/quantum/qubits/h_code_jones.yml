name: 'H code'
introduced: '\cite{arXiv:1210.3388}'

description: 'Family of \([[k+4,k,2]]\) CSS codes with transversal Hadmard gates; relevant to magic state distillation. Four stablizer generators are \(X_1X_2X_3X_4\), \(Z_1Z_2Z_3Z_4\), \(X_1X_2X_5X_6...X_{k+4}\), and \(Z_1Z_2Z_5Z_6...Z_{k+4}\).'

protection: 'Detects weight-1 Pauli errors. The \(r\)-level contatenated H code detects weight Pauli errors up to weight \(2^r-1\).'

features:
  magic_scaling_exponent: 'A total of \(r\) rounds of magic-state distillation yields a magic-state scaling exponent \(\gamma\to 1\) as \(k,r\rightarrow \infty\). This matches a conjectured bound for \(\gamma\) \cite{arXiv:1209.2426}.'
  #, where the number of input states for the protocol is of order \(O(\log^{\gamma}(\epsilon_{in}/\epsilon_{out})\)

  rate: 'The H codes are dense, i.e., the rate \(\frac{k}{k+4}\rightarrow 1\) as \(k \rightarrow \infty\). The distance is 2. However an \(r\)-level concatenation of H codes gives a distance of \(2^r\).'

#  encoders:
#    - 'Standard Clifford-based encoder for H code. It encodes \(k^r\) magic states for a \(r\)-level concatenated H code.'
  transversal_gates: 'Hadamard and \(TXT^{\dagger}\) gates, with the latter Clifford-equivalent to Hadamard, and where \(T=\exp(i\pi(I-Z)/8)\) is the \(\pi/8\)-rotation gate.'

  general_gates:
    - 'The H codes can be used for high-quality and high-efficiency magic-state distillation \cite{arXiv:1210.3388}. Their associated multi-level magic states protocols have an efficency advantage over the 10-to-2 and 15-to-1 protocals for output error below \(10^{-7}\).'

code_id: lifted_product
physical: qubits
logical: qubits

name: 'Lifted product code'
introduced: '\cite{arXiv:1904.02703}'

description: 'A family of \([[n,k,d]]\) CSS codes whose construction is based on two linear \textit{seed} codes \(C_1\) and \(C_2\) with a free action of a group \(G\). Lifted product codes can also be defined over arbitrary matrix rings.'

protection: 'Code performance strongly depends on \(G\), but lifted product codes contain \cite{arXiv:2111.03654} families of QLDPC codes with the parameters \([[n, k = \Theta(n), d = \Theta(n)]]\).'

features:
  rate: 'Lifted product codes include the first examples \cite{arXiv:2111.03654} of \textit{good QLDPC codes}, i.e., codes with asymptotically constant rate and linear distance. The existence of such codes proves the QLDPC conjecture \cite{arXiv:2103.06309}.'

  decoders:
    - 'BP-OSD decoder \cite{arXiv:1904.02703}.'

    - code_id: homological_product
      detail: 'Lifted product obtained from the homological product over a group algebra \(\mathbb{F}_2 G\) of two length-two chain complexes over \(\mathbb{F}_2 G\), i.e., classical binary codes with a free action of the group \(G\).'
#    - code_id: css
#      detail: 'Since lifted product codes are defined by a length-three chain complex they are CSS codes.'
#    - code_id: quantum_ldpc
#      detail: 'Sparsity of seed codes \(C_1\) and \(C_2\) preserved by the lifted product (up to a constant factor), yielding a QLDPC code.'

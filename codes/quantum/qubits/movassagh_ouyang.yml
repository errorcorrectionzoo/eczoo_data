code_id: movassagh_ouyang
physical: qubits
logical: qubits

name: 'Movassagh-Ouyang Hamiltonian code'
introduced: '\cite{arXiv:2012.01453}'

description: |
  This is a family of codes derived via an algorithm that takes as input \textit{any} binary classical code and outputs a quantum code (note that this framework can be extended to \(q\)-ary codes). The algorithm is probabalistic but succeeds almost surely if the classical code is random. An explicit code construction does exist for linear distance codes encoding one logical qubit. For finite rate codes, there is no rigorous proof that the construction algorithm succeeds, and approximate constructions are described instead.

  This family strictly generalizes CSS codes (because CSS codes come only from linear or self orthogonal classical codes). These codes can be shown to be realized as a subspace of the ground space of a (geometrically) local Hamiltonian.

protection: 'Let \(C \subset \{0,1,\dots,q-1\}^n\) be a classical code with distance \(d_x\). Let \(d_z\) satisfy \(q^n > 2 V_q(d_z-1) -1\), where \(V_q(r)\) is the volume of the \(q\)-ary Hamming ball of radius \(r\). Then the algorithm produces a quantum code with distance \(d = \text{min}(d_x,d_z)\). Asymptotically, the distance scales linearly with \(n\).'

features:

  rate: 'The rate depends on the classical code, but distance can scale linearly with \(n\).'

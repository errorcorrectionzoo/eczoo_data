description: >
  A non-CSS QLDPC code constructed from a particular hypergraph product of three linear binary codes.
  The idea is that rather than taking a product of only two classical codes to produce a CSS code, a third classical code is considered, acting with Pauli-\(Y\) operators.

  When the underlying classical codes are 1D (e.g., repetition codes), the XYZ product yields a 3D code. Higher dimensional versions have been constructed \cite{arxiv:2408.03123}.

  rate: >
    Not much has been proven about the relationship between XYZ product codes and other codes.
    The logical dimension depends on properties of the input classical codes, specifically \textit{similarity invariants} from abstract algebra.
    It is conjectured that specific instances of XYZ product codes have a constant encoding rate and a minimum distance of \(d \in \Theta(n^{2/3})\) \cite{arxiv:2011.09746}.

name: 'Hierarchical code'
introduced: '\cite{arxiv:2303.04798}'

description: |-
  Member of a family of \([[n,k,d]]\) qubit stabilizer codes resulting from a concatenation of a constant-rate \hyperref[code:qldpc]{QLDPC code} with a \hyperref[code:rotated_surface]{rotated surface code}.
  Concatenation allows for syndrome extraction to be performed on a 2D geometry while maintining a threshold at the expense of a logarithmically vanishing rate.
  The growing syndrome extraction circuit depth allows known bounds in the literature to be weakened \cite{arxiv:2109.14599,arxiv:2302.04317}.

features:
  rate: 'Rate vanishes as a function of \hyperref[topic:asymptotics]{order} \(\Omega(1/\log(n)^2)\).'

  decoders:
    - 'Decoding is performed as in a standard \hyperref[code:qubit_concatenated]{concatenated code} using a decoder for the inner code and outer code.
    The syndrome extraction circuit depth for the outer code is optimized using a permutation routing algorithm \cite{doi:10.1145/97444.97707}.
    The bilayer architecture allows for logical entangling gates between logical surface-code patches.'
    - 'Soft output decoding \cite{arxiv:2405.07433}.'

  threshold:
    - 'Threshold exists for the locally decaying error model; see \cite[Thm. 1.3]{arxiv:2303.04798}.
    However, the logical error rate below threshold falls super-polynomially (as opposed to exponentially) with the code distance.
    The code family possesses a threshold equal to that of surface codes given by tuning the inner code size for any fixed physical error rate.'

  fault_tolerance:
    - '2D geometrically local syndrome extraction circuits of depth of \hyperref[topic:asymptotics]{order} \(O(\sqrt{n}/R)\) that utilize Clifford and SWAP gates of range \(R\) and that require \hyperref[topic:asymptotics]{order} \(O(n)\) data and ancilla qubits.
    Such parameters (including a range of one) are possible while maintaining a threshold because of the concatenation step.
    This reduces the noise that would otherwise accumulate within a growing-depth syndrome extraction circuit.
    A key idea is that constant-depth syndrome extraction is not a necessary condition for fault-tolerance.'

      detail: 'Hierarchical codes are concatenations of constant-rate QLDPC (outer) codes with (inner) rotated surface codes. The block length of the inner code is picked to grow logarithmically with the block length of the outer code.'

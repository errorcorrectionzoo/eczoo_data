code_id: qcga
physical: qubits
logical: qubits

name: 'High-rate group-algebra code'
introduced: '\cite{arxiv:2308.07915}'

description: |
  One of several specific 2BGA QLDPC qubit codes over Abelian groups with high encoding rate but with minimal non-geometrically local qubit connectivity.

  The qubit connectivity graph is not quite a 2D grid and is instead decomposable into two planar subgraphs of degree three.
  There are \(n\) \(X\) and \(Z\) check operators, with each one of weight six.

features:
  rate: 'When ancilla qubit overhead is included, the encoding rate surpasses that of the surface code.
  A general \([[n,k,d]]\) high-rate group-algebra code requires \(n\) ancilla qubits for encoding, meaning that its \textit{ancilla-added encoding rate} is \(k/2n\).
  For example, the \([[144,12,12]]\) code has ancilla-added rate \(1/24\).
  In contrast, the distance-13 surface code has ancilla-added rate \(1/338\).'

  fault_tolerance:
    - 'Fault-tolerant state initialization using Tanner graph techniques \cite{arxiv:2110.10794} and an ancillary surface code \cite{arxiv:2308.07915}.'

  decoders:
    - 'Syndrome extraction circuit requires seven layers of CNOT gates regardless of code length. BP-OSD decoder \cite{arxiv:1904.02703} has been extended to account for measurement errors (i.e., the circuit-based noise model \cite{arxiv:0803.0272}) \cite{arxiv:2308.07915}.'

  threshold:
    - '\(0.8\%\) for circuit-level noise under BP-OSD decoder \cite{arxiv:2308.07915} (cf. \cite{arxiv:0803.0272}).'

        detail: 'High-rate group-algebra codes are on par with the surface code in terms of threshold, but admit a much higher ancilla-added encoding rate at the expense of having non-geometrically local weight-six check operators.'

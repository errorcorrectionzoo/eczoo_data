code_id: xyz_product
physical: qubits
logical: qubits

name: 'XYZ product code'
introduced: \cite{arxiv:2011.09746}

description: >
  A non-CSS QLDPC code constructed from three classical codes.
  The construction of an XYZ product code is similar to that of a hypergraph product code and related codes.
  The idea is that rather than taking a product of only two classical codes to produce a CSS code, a third classical code is considered, acting with Pauli-\(Y\) operators.

features:

  rate: >
    Not much has been proven about the relationship between XYZ-product codes and other codes.
    The logical dimension depends on properties of the input classical codes, specifically \textit{similarity invariants} from abstract algebra. It is conjectured that specific instances of XYZ-product codes have a constant encoding rate and a minimum distance of \(d \in \Theta(n^{2/3})\) \cite{arxiv:2011.09746}.

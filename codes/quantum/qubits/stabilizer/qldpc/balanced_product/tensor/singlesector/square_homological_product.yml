description: |
  Homological product code whose underlying quantum-code boundary operators are square matrices (see \ref{topic:CSS-to-homology-correspondence}).

  Each base code is associated with the chain complex \( C_i \longrightarrow C_i\longrightarrow C_i\) such that the boundary operator (a.k.a. parity-check matrix) satisfies \(H_i^{2}=0\) \cite[Def. 3.8]{arxiv:1512.07081}. 
  The parity-check check matrix of the resulting product code is 
  \begin{align}
    H_1 \otimes I_2 + I_1 \otimes H_2~,
  \end{align}
  where \(I_i\) is the identity on the check space of code \(i\).
  The logical dimension \(k = k_1 k_2\).

# The image \(im\partial\) forms the parity-check space, and any basis for this space corresponds to the \(Z\)-type stabilizer group generators. 
# The same rule holds for \(im\partial^{T}\), which gives \(X\)-type stabilizer generators. 

# Conversely, \(\ker\partial\setminus \text{im}\partial\) (or \(\partial^{T}\)) correspond to all undetectable \(Z\)-type (\(X\)-type) errors. Finally, the \(Z\)-type logical operators are just elements in the homological group \(\ker\partial/\text{im}\partial\), and \(X\)-type logical operators are just elements in the cohomological group \(ker\partial^{T}/im\partial^{T}\).

# Given two classical codes, \(C_i=[n_i,k_i,d_i]\) with \(i\in\{1,2\}\), whose parity-check matrices \(H_i\) satisfy \(H_i^2 = 0\), their homological product yields two classical codes with \(C_{X,Z}\) with parity-check matrices
# \begin{align}
#   H_X = H_Z^T = H_1 \otimes I + I \otimes H_2~,
# \end{align}
# where \(I\) is the identity.
# These two codes then yield a homological product code via the CSS construction.

  Square homological-product codes admit different properties than those with rectangular boundary operators \cite[Sec. 3.4]{arxiv:1512.07081}.

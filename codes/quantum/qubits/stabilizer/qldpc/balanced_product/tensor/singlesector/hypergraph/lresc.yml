description: |-
  Code constructed using a hypergraph product of two copies of a concatenated LDPC-repetition seed code.
  This family interpolates between surface codes and hypergraph codes since the hypergraph product of two repetition codes yields the planar surface code.
  The construction uses small \([3,2,2]\) and \([6,2,4]\) LDPC codes concatenated with \([4,1,4]\) and \([2,1,2]\) repetition codes, respectively.
  An example using a \([5,2,3]\) code is also presented.

      detail: 'La-cross codes yield LRESCs for \(k=2\).
      La-cross codes have a number of long-range stabilizers that scales linearly with code size, while the number of LRESC long-range stabilizers can be tuned to scale between the square-root of the size and linearly in the size.'

description: |
  A qubit CSS code formulated using a tensor product of two or more chain complexes, each of length one or greater.
  The number of chain complexes participating in the product is the \textit{dimension} of the code.
  When all chain complexes are length-one, meaning that they correspond to classical codes, the code is called a \textit{higher-dimensional HGP code} (a.k.a. multi-sector HGP code or iterative HGP code).

  The stabilizer generator matrices of an \(m\)-dimensional homological product code are the boundary and co-boundary operators of a 2-dimensional chain complex contained within an \(m\)-complex that is recursively constructed by taking the tensor product of an \((m-1)\)-complex and a 1-complex.
  There is freedom in choosing which 2-dimensional chain complex to pick for the code.


protection: |
  The KÃ¼nneth formula gives code properties in terms of the properties of the underlying chain complexes.
  Hypergraph products of multiple classical codes were considered first \cite{arxiv:1512.07081}, followed by products of length-two chain complexes \cite{arxiv:1611.03790,arxiv:1805.09271} (which correspond to qubit CSS codes per the \hyperref[topic:CSS-to-homology-correspondence]{qubit CSS-to-homology correspondence}).
  A general theory and distance bounds are formulated in Ref. \cite{arxiv:1810.01519}.

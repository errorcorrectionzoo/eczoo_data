physical: qubits
logical: qubits

name: '\([[144,12,12]]\) gross code'
introduced: '\cite{arxiv:2308.07915}'

alternative_names:
  - '\((3,3)\) BB code'
  # \cite{arxiv:2410.11942}

description: |
  A BB code which requires less physical and ancilla qubits (for syndrome extraction) than the surface code with the same number of logical qubits and distance.
  The gross code is equivalent to 8 copies of the surface code via a constant-depth Clifford circuit, and is an element of a larger family of 2D stabilizer codes \cite{arxiv:2410.11942}.
  The name stems from the fact that a gross is a dozen dozen.

  A different BB QLDPC code with the same parameters was introduced in \cite{arxiv:2407.16336}.

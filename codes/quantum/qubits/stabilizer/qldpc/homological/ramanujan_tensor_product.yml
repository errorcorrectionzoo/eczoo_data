code_id: ramanujan_tensor_product
physical: qubits
logical: qubits

name: 'High-dimensional expander (HDX) code'
short_name: 'HDX'
introduced: '\cite{arxiv:1409.1397,arXiv:2004.07935}'

description: 'CSS code constructed from a Ramanujan quantum code and an asymptotically good classical LDPC code using distance balancing. Ramanujan quantum codes are defined using Ramanujan complexes which are simplicial complexes that generalise Ramanujan graphs \cite{doi:10.1007/BF02126799,doi:10.1017/CBO9780511615825}. Combining the quantum code obtained from a Ramanujan complex and a good classical LDPC code, which can be thought of as coming from a 1-dimensional chain complex, yields a new quantum code that is defined on a 2-dimensional chain complex. This 2-dimensional chain complex is obtained by the co-complex of the product of the 2 co-complexes. The length, dimension and distance of the new quantum code depend on the input codes.'

protection: 'Without distance balancing, a Ramanujan code can have \(d_X =\Omega(\log n)\) and \(d_Z = \Omega (n)\). For 2D Ramanujan complexes, distance-balanced codes protect against errors with minimum distance \(d = \Omega(\sqrt{n \log n})\). For 3D Ramanujan complexes, distance-balanced codes protect against errors with minimum distance \(d= \Omega(\sqrt{n} \log n )\).'

features:

  rate: 'For 2D Ramanujan complexes, the rate is \(\Omega(\sqrt{ \frac{1}{n \log n} })\), with minimum distance \(d = \Omega(\sqrt{n \log n}) \). For 3D, the rate is \( \Omega(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}\log n}) \) with minimum distance \(d \geq \sqrt{n} \log n \).'

  decoders:
    - 'For 2D simplicial complexes, cycle code decoder admitting a polynomial-time decoding algorithm can be used \cite{arXiv:2004.07935}.'

notes:
  - 'Codes were first to break a 20-year record set by the \hyperref[code:freedman_meyer_luo]{Freedman-Meyer-Luo code} for the lower bound on scaling of the minimum distance \cite{arXiv:2103.06309}.'

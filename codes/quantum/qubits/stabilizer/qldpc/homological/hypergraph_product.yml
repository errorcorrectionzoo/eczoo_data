code_id: hypergraph_product
physical: qubits
logical: qubits

name: 'Hypergraph product (HGP) code'
short_name: 'HGP'
introduced: '\cite{arXiv:0903.0566,arxiv:1202.0928}'

description: 'A family of \([[n,k,d]]\) CSS codes whose construction is based on two binary linear \textit{seed} codes \(C_1\) and \(C_2\).'
# Could be expanded to include Tanner graphs
# Defn of CSS has been changed to accomodate this... In contrast to the original CSS construction there are no restrictions on the form of \(C_1\) and \(C_2\).'

protection: 'The hypergraph product has distance \(d=O(\sqrt{n})\). The number of encoded logical qubits is \(k=O(k_1k_2)\) where \(k_1\) and \(k_2\) are the dimensions of the classical seed codes \(C_1\) and \(C_2\).'

#notes:
# VVA: Added already as cousin entry. - 'The surface code can be constructed form the hypergraph product of two repetition codes. Similarily, the toric code is obtained from the hypergraph product of two closed-loop repetition codes.'

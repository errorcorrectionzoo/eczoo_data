name: 'Hypergraph product (HGP) code'
short_name: 'HGP'
introduced: '\cite{arXiv:0903.0566,arxiv:1202.0928}'

description: |
  A family of \([[n,k,d]]\) CSS codes whose construction is based on two binary linear \textit{seed} codes, \(C_i=[n_i,k_i,d_i]\) with \(i\in\{1,2\}\).
  Given the two seed parity-check matrices \(H_{1,2}\), the hypergraph product yields two classical codes \(C_{X,Z}\) with parity-check matrices
  \begin{align}
    H_{X}&=\begin{pmatrix}H_{1}\otimes I_{n_{2}} & \,\,I_{n_{1}-k_{1}}\otimes H_{2}^{T}\end{pmatrix}\\
    H_{Z}&=\begin{pmatrix}I_{n_{1}}\otimes H_{2} & \,\,H_{1}^{T}\otimes I_{n_{2}-k_{2}}\end{pmatrix}~,
  \end{align}
  where \(I_m\) is the \(m\)-dimensional identity matrix.
  These two codes then yield a hypergraph product code via the CSS construction.


# Could be expanded to include Tanner graphs
# Defn of CSS has been changed to accomodate this... In contrast to the original CSS construction there are no restrictions on the form of \(C_1\) and \(C_2\).'

protection: 'The hypergraph product has distance \(d=O(\sqrt{n})\). The number of encoded logical qubits is \(k=O(k_1k_2)\) where \(k_1\) and \(k_2\) are the dimensions of the classical seed codes \(C_1\) and \(C_2\).'

#notes:
# VVA: Added already as cousin entry. - 'The surface code can be constructed form the hypergraph product of two repetition codes. Similarily, the toric code is obtained from the hypergraph product of two closed-loop repetition codes.'

name: 'Fiber-bundle code'
introduced: '\cite{arxiv:2009.03921}'

alternative_names:
  - 'Twisted product code'

description: 'A CSS code constructed by combining one code as the base and another as the fiber of a fiber bundle.
In particular, taking a random LDPC code as the base and a cyclic repetition code as the fiber yields, after distance balancing, a QLDPC code with distance of \hyperref[topic:asymptotics]{order} \(\Omega(n^{3/5}\text{polylog}(n))\) and rate of \hyperref[topic:asymptotics]{order} \(\Omega(n^{-2/5}\text{polylog}(n))\) is obtained.'
#In addition, weight reduction can be used to make this an \([[n,\Omega(n^{3/5}/\text{polylog}(n),\Omega(n^{3/5}/\text{polylog}(n))]]\) QLDPC code family.'

#protection: 'Pauli errors up to weight \(\Omega(n^{3/5}\text{polylog}(n))\).'
features:

  rate: 'Rate \(k/n = \Omega(n^{-2/5}/\text{polylog}(n))\), distance \(d=\Omega(n^{3/5}/\text{polylog}(n))\). This is the first QLDPC code to achieve a distance scaling better than \(\sqrt{n}~\text{polylog}(n)\).'

  decoders:
    - 'Greedy algorithm can be used to efficiently decode \(X\) errors, but no known efficient decoding of \(Z\) errors yet \cite{arxiv:2009.03921}.'

        The specific fiber-bundle QLDPC code achieving a distance scaling better than \(\sqrt{n}~\text{polylog}(n)\) can also be formulated directly as an LP code (see published version of Ref.\cite{arxiv:2009.03921}).
        Lifted products of a length-one with a length-\(m\) chain complex can be thought of as fiber-bundle codes \cite{arxiv:2012.09271}.

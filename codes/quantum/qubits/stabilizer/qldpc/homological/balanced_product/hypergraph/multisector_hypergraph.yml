description: |
  A CSS code constructed from a hypergraph product of two or more classical linear binary codes.
  The stabilizer generator matrices of an \(m\)-dimensional hypergraph product code are the boundary and co-boundary operators of a 2-dimensional chain complex contained within an \(m\)-complex that is recursively constructed by taking the tensor product of an \((m-1)\)-complex and a 1-complex, with each 1-complex corresponding to some classical linear binary code.

protection: |
  The KÃ¼nneth formula gives code properties in terms of the properties of the underlying classical codes.

# Parent is placeholder; extend to multisector_homological
# A homological product of chain complexes corresponding to two linear binary codes is a hypergraph product code \cite{arxiv:2009.03921}. Homological product codes constructed with diagonal boundary operators admit very different properties than those with rectangular boundary operators.

code_id: qcga
physical: qubits
logical: qubits

name: 'Bivariate bicycle (BB) code'
short_name: 'BB'
introduced: '\cite{arxiv:2308.07915}'

description: |
  One of several Abelian 2BGA codes which admit time-optimal syndrome measurement circuits that can be implemented in a two-layer
  architecture, a generalization of the square-lattice architecture
  optimal for the surface codes.

  The qubit connectivity graph is not quite a 2D grid and is instead decomposable into two planar subgraphs of degree three; there exists an optimized layout minimizing Euclidean communication distance for check operators \cite{arxiv:2404.18809}.
  There are \(n\) \(X\) and \(Z\) check operators, with each one of weight six.

  Several variants and generalizations exist \cite{arxiv:2406.19151,arxiv:2408.10001}.

protection: |
  Admits an \(0.8\%\) \hyperref[topic:pseudo-threshold]{pseudo-threshold} for circuit-level noise under BP-OSD decoder \cite{arxiv:2308.07915} (cf. \cite{arxiv:0803.0272}).

features:
  transversal_gates:
    - 'Logical Pauli operators and fold-transversal gates studied in Ref. \cite{arxiv:2407.03973}.'

  rate: 'When ancilla qubit overhead is included, the encoding rate surpasses that of the surface code.
  A general \([[n,k,d]]\) bivariate bicycle code requires \(n\) ancilla qubits for encoding, meaning that its \textit{ancilla-added encoding rate} is \(k/2n\).'

  fault_tolerance:
    - 'Fault-tolerant state initialization using lattice surgery techniques \cite{arxiv:2110.10794,arxiv:2308.08648} and an ancillary surface code \cite{arxiv:2308.07915}.'

  decoders:
    - 'Syndrome extraction circuit requires seven layers of CNOT gates regardless of code length. BP-OSD decoder \cite{arxiv:1904.02703} has been extended \cite{arxiv:2308.07915} to account for measurement errors (i.e., the circuit-based noise model \cite{arxiv:0803.0272}).'
    - 'Random and optimized syndrome extraction schedules from Ref. \cite{arxiv:2308.07915} are not \hyperref[topic:effective-distance]{distance-preserving}.'
    - 'Some long-range check operators can be measured less frequently than others \cite{arxiv:2404.17676}.'
    - 'Syndrome extraction circuits called \textit{morphing circuits} \cite{arxiv:2407.16336}, generalizing circuits for the color code \cite{arxiv:2312.08813}.'

Bivariate bicycle codes are on par with the surface code in terms of threshold, but admit a much higher ancilla-added encoding rate at the expense of having non-geometrically local weight-six check operators.'

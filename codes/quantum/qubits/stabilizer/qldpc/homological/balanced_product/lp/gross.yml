code_id: gross
physical: qubits
logical: qubits

name: '\([[144,12,12]]\) gross code'
introduced: '\cite{arxiv:2308.07915}'

alternative_names:
  - '\((3,3)\) BB code'
  # \cite{arxiv:2410.11942}

description: |
  A BB code which requires less physical and ancilla qubits (for syndrome extraction) than the surface code with the same number of logical qubits and distance.
  The gross code is equivalent to 8 copies of the surface code via a constant-depth Clifford circuit, and is an element of a larger family of 2D stabilizer codes \cite{arxiv:2410.11942}.
  The name stems from the fact that a gross is a dozen dozen.

  A different BB QLDPC code with the same parameters was introduced in \cite{arxiv:2407.16336}.

protection: |
  Admits a \hyperref[topic:pseudo-threshold]{pseudo-threshold} of \(\approx 0.7\%\) for the circuit-based noise model.

features:
  rate: 'An ancilla-added rate of \(1/24\). In contrast, the distance-13 surface code has ancilla-added rate \(1/338\).'

  general_gates:
    - 'Clifford gates \cite{arxiv:2407.18393}.'

  decoders:
    - 'The GDG sliding-window decoder \cite{arxiv:2403.18901}, with a realization achieving a worst-case decoding latency of 3ms per window.'
    - 'AC decoder is faster than ordinary BP-OSD with no reduction of fidelity \cite{arxiv:2406.14527}.'

The gross code is equivalent to 8 copies of the surface code via a constant-depth Clifford circuit, and is an element of a larger family of 2D stabilizer codes \cite{arxiv:2410.11942}. An architecture combining the surface and gross codes was proposed in \cite{arxiv:2411.03202}.'

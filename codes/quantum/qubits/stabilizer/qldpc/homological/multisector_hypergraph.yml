name: 'Higher-dimensional homological product code'
introduced: '\cite{arxiv:1810.01519,arxiv:2009.14226}'

alternative_names:
  - 'Higher-dimensional tensor product code'
  - 'Multi-sector homological product code'
  - 'Multi-sector tensor product code'

description: |
  A CSS code formulated using a tensor product of two or more chain complexes, each of length one or greater.
  The number of chain complexes participating in the product is the \textit{dimension} of the code.
  When all chain complexes are length-one, meaning that they correspond to classical codes, the code is called a \textit{higher-dimensional HGP code}.

  The stabilizer generator matrices of an \(m\)-dimensional homological product code are the boundary and co-boundary operators of a 2-dimensional chain complex contained within an \(m\)-complex that is recursively constructed by taking the tensor product of an \((m-1)\)-complex and a 1-complex.

protection: |
  The KÃ¼nneth formula gives code properties in terms of the properties of the underlying chain complexes.

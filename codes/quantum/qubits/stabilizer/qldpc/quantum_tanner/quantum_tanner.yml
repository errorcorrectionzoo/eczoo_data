description: |
  Member of a family of QLDPC codes based on two compatible classical Tanner codes defined on a two-dimensional Cayley complex.
  For certain choices of codes and complex, the resulting codes have asymptotically good parameters.

  The underlying geometric complex of the code is a left-right Cayley complex \(\operatorname{Cay}_2(A,G,B)\), where \(G\) is a finite group and \(A=A^{-1}\), \(B=B^{-1}\) are two symmetric generating sets satisfying the total no-conjugacy condition: \(ag\ne gb\) for any \(g\in G\), \(a\in A\), and \(b\in B\).
  The vertices of the complex are group elements, i.e., \(V=G\). If necessary, the double cover of the graph should be taken so that the graph is bipartite, \(V=V_0\sqcup V_1\).

  There are two types of edges in the resulting complex,
    \begin{align}
    \begin{split}
      E_A &= \{(g,ag): g\in G, a\in A\}\\
      E_B &= \{(g,gb): g\in G, b\in B\}~.
    \end{split}
    \end{align}
  The faces are squares defined by quadruples,
    \begin{align}
      Q = \{(g,ag,gb,agb): g\in G, a\in A, b\in B\}~.
    \end{align}
  Two additional graphs can be obtained from \(\operatorname{Cay}_2(A,G,B)\) by taking the diagonals of the squares as edges, \(\mathcal G_0^\square = (V_0, Q)\) and \(\mathcal G_1^\square = (V_1, Q)\).

  In the quantum Tanner construction, qubits are placed on the squares of the left-right Cayley complex.
  Two classical codes \(C_A\) and \(C_B\) of blocklengths \(|A|\) and \(|B|\), respectively, are chosen, yielding local codes \(C_0 = C_A\otimes C_B\) and \(C_1 = C_A^\perp\otimes C_B^\perp\).
  The quantum Tanner code is a CSS code defined by the classical Tanner codes \(C_Z = T(\mathcal G_0^\square, C_0^\perp)\) and \(C_X = T(\mathcal G_1^\square, C_1^\perp)\).
  The figure below depicts an example of a stabilizer generator.

    \caption{An example of a \(Z\) generator on a \(V_0\) local view when \(C_A = \{000\}\) and \(C_B=\{110, 011\}\). The faces incident to a \(V_0\) vertex are in bijection with the set \(A\times B\), and a codeword of \(C_0 = C_A\otimes C_B\) can be described using this set.}

  To achieve asymptotically good parameters, fixed classical local codes are chosen so that their dual tensor codes are sufficiently robust, and the left-right Cayley complexes are chosen to be sufficiently expanding. The family is defined using a family of groups \(G\) of increasing size but constant-size generating sets \(A\), \(B\).


protection: 'For correctly chosen complexes and local codes, the distance scales as \(d=\Theta(n)\). Minimum distance bound obtained using robustness of dual \hyperref[code:tensor]{tensor-product} codes \cite{arxiv:2208.05537}.'

features:
  rate: 'Asymptotically good QLDPC codes. When \(C_A\) and \(C_B\) are chosen to have rates not equal to a half, the number of encoded qubits scales as \(k=\Theta(n)\).'

name: 'Haah cubic code (CC)'
short_name: 'CC'
introduced: '\cite{arxiv:1101.1962}'

description: |
  A 3D lattice stabilizer code on a length-\(L\) cubic lattice with one or two qubits per site.
  Admits two types of stabilizer generators with support on each cube of the lattice.
  In the non-CSS case, these two are related by spatial inversion.
  For CSS codes, we require that the product of all corner operators is the identity.
  We lastly require that there are no non-trivial string operators, meaning that single-site operators are a phase, and any period one logical operator \(l \in \mathsf{S}^{\perp}\) is just a phase.

  Haah showed in his original construction that there is exactly one non-CSS code of this form, and 17 CSS codes \cite{arxiv:1101.1962}.
  The non-CSS code is labeled code 0, and the rest are numbered from 1 - 17.
  Codes CC1-CC4, CC7, CC8, and CC10 do not have string logical operators \cite{arxiv:1101.1962,arxiv:1908.08049}.
  A fractal Ising model can be used to obtain one of these codes by gauging \cite{arxiv:1202.3120,arxiv:1407.1025,arxiv:1603.04442,arxiv:1603.05182,arxiv:1605.01640,arxiv:1805.01836,arxiv:1806.08679,arXiv:2108.11402,arxiv:2310.16032,arxiv:2410.02213} its subsystem symmetry \cite{arxiv:1603.04442,arxiv:1603.05182}.

  Under renormalization group flow \cite{arxiv:1310.4507}, cubic code 1 fragments into itself and the \textit{Haah B-code} (a.k.a. \textit{CC1B}), which has four qubits per unit cell \cite[Eq. (D2)]{arxiv:1908.08049}\cite{arxiv:1909.12304}.
  In this context, cubic code 1 is sometimes called the \textit{Haah A-code} or \textit{CC1A}.
  Cubic codes 11-17 fragment into combinations of themselves, their corresponding B-codes, and stacks of surface codes \cite[Table 1]{arxiv:1909.12304}.

  The Haah A-code can be written in a similar form as the Sierpinski prism model code \cite{arxiv:2112.14717}.
  The Haah B-code admits a topological defect network construction out of two copies of the 3D surface code \cite{arxiv:2002.05166}.

  Encodings using geometries with boundaries as well as lattice defects have been studied \cite{arxiv:2308.00138}.
  CC1A and CC1B have been generalized to manifolds more general than 3D lattices \cite{arxiv:1812.02101,arxiv:1902.04543}.

protection: 'Cubic codes protect against simultaneous independent Pauli errors on different sites (not qubits, since there can be 2 qubits per site). Codes CC0-CC4 are known to have distance \(d \ge L\), meaning they can achieve macroscopic code distance as \(L\to\infty\).'

features:
  decoders:
    - 'Hard-decisions RG decoder \cite{arxiv:1112.3252}.'
  threshold:
    - 'The encoding rate depends on the code implemented, but code CC0 has been shown to have \(k \ge L\) (on a periodic finite cubic lattice of side length \(L\). In general we expect the number of logical qubits to scale as \(k = \Omega(L)\).'

#notes:
#  - 'A relation \(k d = O(L^3) \) between code parameters on 3D lattices \cite{arxiv:0909.5200}, meaning that we must have fewer qubits per site \(m\) than types of generator \(t\), since if \(t < m\) then \(d = O(1)\).'

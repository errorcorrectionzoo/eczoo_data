name: 'Fusion-based quantum computing (FBQC) code'
short_name: 'FBQC'
introduced: '\cite{arxiv:2101.09310}'

description: |
  Code whose codewords are resource states used in an FBQC scheme. Related to a cluster state via Hadamard transformations.

  FBQC is a fault tolerant way to produce \textit{fusion networks}, or large entangled resource states starting from small constant-sized entangled resource states along with destructive measurements called \textit{fusions}.
  These large states can be produced asychronously in the fusion framework and can be used as resources, as in measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC), or as logical states of topological codes.
  The difference from ordinary MBQC is that error-correction two-qubit measurements are performed, which requires a foliation with more qubits.
  The use of two-qubit measurements makes FBQC more compatible with photonic platforms.

protection: 'Protects against erasure, Pauli errors, \hyperref[topic:ad]{photon loss}, fusion failure from non-determinism, and faulty resource states. Redundancy in fusion outcomes is captured by the check operator group. Fusion measurement outcomes form a syndrome that allows to correct for Pauli errors. There is no physical error correction, and decoding output is simply used to update the Pauli frame.'

features:
  encoders:
    - 'Resource state generators, which produce small constant size cluster states, and Fusion measurements (Bell fusions).'

  general_gates:
    - '\hyperref[topic:clifford]{Clifford gates} are performed by creating topological features such as boundaries, defects, or twists, which can be done by single qubit measurements.
    Logical gates can also be performed by code deformation.

    Non-Clifford gates are perfomed by magic-state injection.'

    # - 'Logical Clifford operations can be kept track of using the classical Pauli-frame register and need not be explicitly applied at the quantum level.'

#  decoders:
#    - 'Logical timescales are separated from the physical measurement timescales.'
#    - 'Decoding syndrome information is tracked in the Pauli frame.'

  fault_tolerance:
    - 'Fusion networks are constructed in a fault tolerant way (as a stabilizer code), and they can be created in a way that naturally encodes topological fault tolerance.
    There is a large family of fault-tolerant protocols \cite{arxiv:2308.07844}.'

  threshold:
    - '\(11.98\%\) against erasure in fusion measurements.'
    - '\(1.07\%\) against Pauli error.'
    - 'In linear optical systems, can tolerate \(10.4\%\) probability of \hyperref[topic:ad]{photon loss} in each fusion.'
    - '\(43.2\%\) against fusion failure.'
    - 'FBQC applied to the surface code yields thresholds for logical gates that is consistent with the code capacity threshold \cite{arxiv:2112.12160}.'

relations:
  parents:
    - code_id: qubit_stabilizer
      detail: 'The resource states in FBQC are small stabilizer states, and after fusion measurements, the outputs are stabilizers (conditioned on measurement outcomes).'
  cousins:
    - code_id: topological
      detail: 'Arbitrary topological codes can be created using FBQC, as can topological features such as defects and boundaries, by modifying fusion measurements or adding single qubit measurements.'
    - code_id: dual_rail
      detail: 'FBQC resource states are concatenated with dual-rail codes to increase loss detection.'
    - code_id: dynamic_gen
      detail: 'Building a fusion network is done using a measurement-based dynamical process.'

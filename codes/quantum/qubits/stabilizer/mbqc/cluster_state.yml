name: 'Cluster-state code'
introduced: '\cite{arxiv:quant-ph/0004051}'

alternative_names:
  - 'Graph-state code'

description: |
  A code based on a cluster state and often used in measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC) \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/0108118,doi:10.1103/PhysRevLett.86.5188} (a.k.a. one-way quantum processing), which substitutes the temporal dimension necessary for decoding a conventional code with a spatial dimension.
  This is done by encoding the computation into the features of the cluster state''s graph.

  Cluster states are stabilizer states defined on a graph.
  There is one stabilizer generator \(S_j\) per graph vertex \(j\) of the form
  \begin{align}
    S_j = X_{j} \prod_{k\in N(j)} Z_k~,
  \end{align}
  where the neighborhood \(N(j)\) is the set of vertices which share an edge with \(j\).
  
  A type of cluster-state code can be built from a cluster state by applying the CWS construction using a linear binary code, in which codewords are obtained by applying \(Z\)-type operators defined by the code to the cluster state; see, e.g., Ref. \cite{arxiv:2304.08363}. \hyperref[topic:quantum-weight-enumerator]{Pure} CWS codes can be constructed from uniform graphs \cite{arxiv:2405.06142}.

  By contrast, MBQC schemes utilize single cluster states.
  An MBQC scheme can be constructed out of any qubit CSS code (via \textit{foliation} \cite{arxiv:1607.02579}; see also Ref. \cite{arxiv:1705.05602}) or qubit stabilizer code \cite{arxiv:1811.11780}.
  Foliation of a CSS code can be interpreted as a product of the code's chain complex with another complex \cite{arxiv:2410.12963}.
  The original MBQC scheme \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/0510135,arxiv:quant-ph/0610082} uses the RBH cluster state on the bcc lattice (i.e., a cubic lattice with qubits on edges and faces).

  Since they are stabilizer states, two cluster states are considered local-Clifford equivalent if they can be mapped into each other under a tensor product of arbitrary \hyperref[topic:clifford]{single-qubit Clifford} operations.
  Such operations can sometimes be done via local complementation (LC) of the underlying graph \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/0307130,arxiv:quant-ph/0308151}.
  More generally, any two local-unitary equivalent cluster states can be mapped into each other by operations at some level of the hierarchy \cite{arxiv:2409.20183}, meaning that general tensor-product unitaries are not needed.
  Cluster states on \(\leq 19\) qubits are LC equivalent if and only if they are local-unitary equivalent \cite{arxiv:2409.20183}, and there exists a cluster state on \(27\) qubits that is LC but not local-unitary equivalent \cite{arxiv:0709.1266,arxiv:0812.4625,arxiv:1910.03969}.
  Local complementation has been generalized to graphically characterize local unitary equivalence under local Clifford operations and, more generally, at other levels of the \term{Clifford hierarchy} \cite{arxiv:2409.20183}.

protection: |
  Protection is related to the stabilizer code underlying the cluster state.
  There is no physical error correction, and decoding output is simply used to update the Pauli frame.

  There exist necessary and sufficient conditions for a family of cluster states to exhibit \hyperref[topic:tqo]{TQO-1} \cite{arxiv:2112.02502}.
  \hyperref[topic:quantum-weight-enumerator]{Quantum weight enumerators} of cluster state codes are known as sector weights \cite{arxiv:1905.06928,arxiv:1908.04220,arxiv:2105.12752,arxiv:2207.07665}.

  Potential and limits of MBQC using probabilistic gates has been studied \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/0605014}.
  Cluster states can be optimized to be robust against qubit erasure \cite{arxiv:2212.04834}.

features:

    - 'Initialization of all qubits in the \(|+\rangle\) state and action of \(CZ\) gates along the edges of the graph.'
    - 'Optimal-depth preparation based on graph coloring \cite{arxiv:1011.5464}.'
    - 'A cluster-like state, or a state that is in the same SPT phase as a cluster state, can be prepared in finite time \cite{arxiv:2107.04019}.'
    - 'ZX calculus based encoder representation \cite{arxiv:2304.08363}.'

  general_gates:
    - 'The computation encoded in pre-determined fashion via topological features of the cluster state''s graph, such as boundaries, defects, or twists. Such features can be created using \(Z\)-type measurements, which effectively cut a qubit off from the cluster state. Non-Clifford gates are performed by inserting \hyperref[topic:clifford]{non-Clifford} states into particular \textit{singular} qubits. More generally, any gate protocol of a qubit stabilizer code yields an MBQC protocol \cite{arxiv:1811.11780}.
    To perform the computation, subsets qubits are measured, e.g., along one two-dimensional slice of a 3D lattice for each time step.
    This effectively teleports the logical information into the remaining unmeasured portion of the cluster state.
    The computation terminates after all qubits are measured.

    The entire cluster state does not need to be created at the start of the computation. Instead, the portion of the cluster state in the extra dimension can be initialized as the computation progresses.'

    - 'Clifford operations can be realized as operations acting on graphs underlying a cluster state \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/0308151}. They can be done in any order, demonstrating \textit{parallelism} \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/0108067}.'

  decoders:

  code_capacity_threshold:
    - 'Independent \(X,Z\) noise: \(p_X = 2.9\%\) under MWPM decoding \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/0510135}.
    The threshold under ML decoding corresponds to the value of a critical point of the 3D random-plaquette \(\mathbb{Z}_2\) gauge theory (3D-RPGM) via the statistical mechanical mapping \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/0110143}, calculated to be \(3.3 \%\) \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/0401101} (see also \cite{arxiv:cond-mat/0501372}).'

# Do only local measurements, X in the bulk (vacuum V)
# Multiply outcomes to get stabilizers XXXXXX on cube, which is the same as product of cluster state stabs on a cube since Z's cancel
# This diagnoses for Z errors
#
# Z-type error correction round measures Z in the bulk (defect D), which yields ZZZZZZ when multiplied together on a cube
# This diagnoses for X errors

# 3D cluster state has anyonic strings

# Logical info is no desctroyed, but teleported layer by layer along the third direction

# Storage capacity depends upon the topology of the code surface
#   Rough/smooth boundaries
#   Tori = 2 qubits
#   Planes with two holes = 1 qubit
# Gates consist of building a 3D lattice in which holes are twisted. Cluster state is using 3rd spatial dim for a temporal one.
# Lattice surgery also can be scaffolded in.

# So information is effectively stored near the boundary of the 2D slice. Measuring slice by slice will teleport it to the next slice.

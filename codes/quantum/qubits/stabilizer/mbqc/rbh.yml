  - 'Raussendorf-Harrington-Goyal (RHG) cluster-state code'

description: |
  A three-dimensional cluster-state code defined on the bcc lattice (i.e., a cubic lattice with qubits on edges and faces).

  The MBQC version of the code is defined as the unique ground state of a certain code Hamiltonian. This state is the resource state used in the first MBQC scheme \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/0510135,arxiv:quant-ph/0610082}.
  It encodes the temporal gate operations on the surface code into a third spatial dimension.

  Addition of certain boundary Hamiltonians yields a degenerate ground-state space that serves as an example of a symmetry-protected self-correcting memory \cite{arxiv:1805.01474}.

protection: |
  Exhibits symmetry-protected self-correction \cite{arxiv:1805.01474}. The energy barrier for symmetry-preserving excitations outside of the code space grows linearly with the lattice width. When the system is coupled locally to a thermal bath respecting the symmetry and below a critical temperature, the memory time grows exponentially with the lattice width.

features:
  general_gates:
    - 'The computation encoded in pre-determined fashion via topological features of the lattice, such as boundaries, defects, or twists.
    For example, qubits may be encoded in 2D defects along slices of the surface code, and \hyperref[topic:clifford]{Clifford gates} are encoded by spatially braiding the defects along the 3rd dimension.
    Non-Clifford gates are performed by inserting \hyperref[topic:clifford]{non-Clifford} states into particular \textit{singular} qubits.

    To perform the computation, qubits along the extra dimension are measured, e.g., along one two-dimensional slice per time step.
    This effectively teleports the logical information into the remaining unmeasured portion of the cluster state.'

  decoders:
    - 'MBQC syndrome extraction consists of single-qubit measurements and classical post-processing. The six \(X\)-measurements of qubits on the faces of a cube of the bcc lattice multiply to the product of the six cluster-state stabilizers whose vertices are on the faces of the cube. Such measurements, if done on a 2D slice, also yield \(Z\)-type syndromes on the next slice.'
    - 'Minimum weight perfect-matching (MWPM) \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/0110143,arxiv:1307.1740} (based on work by Edmonds on finding a matching in a graph \cite{doi:10.4153/CJM-1965-045-4,doi:10.6028/jres.069B.013}).'

  threshold:

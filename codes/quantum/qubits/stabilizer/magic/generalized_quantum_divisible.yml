name: 'Generalized quantum divisible code'
introduced: '\cite{arxiv:1709.08658}'

description: |
  A level-\(\nu\) generalized quantum divisible code is a CSS code whose \(X\)-type stabilizers, in the symplectic representation, have zero norm and form a \((\nu,t)\)-null matrix (defined below) with respect to some odd-integer vector \(t\) \cite[Def. V.1]{arxiv:1709.08658}.
  Such codes admit gates at the \(\nu\)th level of the \term{Clifford hierarchy}.
  Such codes can also be level-lifted \cite[Theorem V.6]{arxiv:1709.08658}, \(\nu\to\nu+1\), which recursively yields towers of generalized divisible codes from a particular ground code.

  Given an odd-integer coefficient length-\(n\) vector \(t\), two vectors \(v,w\) are \((\nu,t)\)\textit{-orthogonal} if
  \begin{align}
  	\sum_i v_i t_i w_i \equiv 0 \mod 2^{\nu-1}~.
  \end{align}
  A matrix whose rows make up such vectors is called \((\nu,t)\)-orthogonal.

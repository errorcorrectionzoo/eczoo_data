name: 'Three-fermion (3F) Walker-Wang model code'
short_name: '3F Walker-Wang'
introduced: '\cite{arxiv:1302.7072,arxiv:2011.04693}'

description: |
  A 3D lattice stabilizer code whose low-energy excitations on boundaries realize a 3D time-reversal SPT order \cite{arxiv:1302.7072} and that can be used as a resource state for fault-tolerant MBQC \cite{arxiv:2011.04693}.
  The anyons at the boundary of the lattice are described by the 3F anyon theory.

features:
  encoders:
    - '3F QCA encoder \cite{arxiv:1812.01625,arxiv:2205.09141}, which can be simplified using bosonization \cite{arxiv:2309.15903} and can be extended to SPTs in higher dimensions based on an exact bosonization duality \cite{arxiv:2407.07951}.'

  general_gates:
    - 'Clifford gates can be performed by braiding and fusing symmetry defects in the MBQC model.'

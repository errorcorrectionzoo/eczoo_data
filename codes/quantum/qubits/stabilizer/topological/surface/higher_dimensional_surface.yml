description: |
  CSS-type extenstion of the Kitaev surface code to arbitrary manifolds.
  The version on a Euclidean manifold of some fixed dimension is called the \(D\)\textit{-dimensional "surface"} or \(D\)\textit{-dimensional toric} code.

  Given a cellulation of a manifold, qubits are put on \(i\)-dimensional faces, \(X\)-type stabilizers
  are associated with \((i-1)\)-faces, while \(Z\)-type stabilizers are associated with \((i+1)\)-faces.

  Lattice surface codes in \(D\) spatial dimensions can be partially classified by the dimension of their stabilizer generators (and corresponding excitations).
  There are \((p,q)\) \textit{surface codes} for \(p+q=D\) realized by \(Z\)-type stabilizer generators of dimension \(p\) and \(X\)-type stabilizer generators of dimension \(q\).
  The two corresponding types of excitations are of dimension \(p-1\) and \(q-1\), respectively.

  In addition, one has to classify the self statistics of the codes' excitations.
  For example, there are three types of \((1,3)\) surface codes in 3D, corresponding to the three types of \(\mathbb{Z}_2\) Abelian topological orders: one with bosonic charge and loop excitations (BcBl) and two with fermionic charge excitations and bosonic (FcBl) and fermionic (FcFl) loop excitations, respectively \cite{arxiv:2011.11165,arxiv:2110.14654}.
  There exists an invariant that distinguishes these \cite{arxiv:2110.14654}.

protection: |
  The 4D \((2,2)\) all-loop surface code serves as a self-correcting quantum memory, while surface codes in higher dimensions can have distances not possible in lower dimensions.

  rate: |
    Rate depends on the underlying cellulation and manifold \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/0110143,arxiv:1606.07116}.
    For general 2D
    manifolds, \(kd^2\leq c(\log k)^2 n\) for some constant \(c\)
    \cite{arxiv:1301.6588}, meaning that (1) 2D surface codes with bounded
    geometry have distance scaling at most as \(O(\sqrt{n})\)
    \cite{arxiv:0909.5200,doi:10.1063/1.4726034}, and (2) surface codes with
    finite rate can only achieve an asymptotic minimum distance that is
    logarithmic in \(n\).
    Higher-dimensional manifolds yield distances scaling more favorably.
    Loewner's theorem
    provides an upper bound for any bounded-geometry surface code
    \cite{doi:10.1201/9781420035377-13}.

      detail: 'The generalized surface code is constructed from chain complexes arising from cell complexes of the underlying manifold. Such complexes are not necessarily products of two non-trivial complexes, but the manifolds are picked so that their homology ensures favorable code properties.'

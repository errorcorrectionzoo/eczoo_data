description: |
  A CSS extension of the Kitaev surface code to arbitrary manifolds.
  The version on a Euclidean manifold of some fixed dimension is called the \(D\)\textit{-dimensional "surface"} or \(D\)\textit{-dimensional toric} code.

  Given a cellulation of a manifold, qubits are put on \(p\)-dimensional faces, \(X\)-type stabilizers
  are associated with \((p-1)\)-faces, while \(Z\)-type stabilizers are associated with \((p+1)\)-faces.
  Here, \(p\) ranges between \(1\) and \(D-1\).

  Lattice surface codes in \(D\) spatial dimensions can be partially classified by the dimension of their stabilizer generators (and corresponding excitations).
  There are \((p,q)\) \textit{surface codes} for \(q = D-p\) \cite{arxiv:1508.03468}.
  Applying this construction to the dual lattice of a \((p,q)\) surface code yields a \((q,p)\) surface code.
  All lattice surface codes have bosonic \(e\) and \(m\) excitations of dimension \(p-1\) and \(q-1\), respectively. Their logical operators are also of dimension \(p\) and \(q\), respectively.

  In 2D, there is only the \((1,1)\) surface code, which is equivalent to the Kitaev surface code and which admits point-like \(e\) and \(m\) excitations.
  In 3D, there are the \((1,2)\) and \((2,1)\) 3D surface codes, which are equivalent by Hadamard gates. Both admit point-like excitations of one type and loop-like excitations of the other.
  In 4D, there are the \((1,3)\), \((2,2)\), and \((3,1)\) 4D surface codes, with the last two being equivalent by Hadamard gates. The \((1,3)\) code admits point-like \(e\) excitations and 3D membrane \(m\) excitations, while the \((2,2)\) loop toric code admits loop-like \(e\) and \(m\) excitations.


protection: |
  The 4D \((2,2)\) loop surface code serves as a self-correcting quantum memory, while surface codes in higher dimensions can have distances not possible in lower dimensions.

  rate: |
    Rate depends on the underlying cellulation and manifold \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/0110143,arxiv:1606.07116}.
    For general 2D
    manifolds, \(kd^2\leq c(\log k)^2 n\) for some constant \(c\)
    \cite{arxiv:1301.6588}, meaning that (1) 2D surface codes with bounded
    geometry have distance scaling at most as \(O(\sqrt{n})\)
    \cite{arxiv:0909.5200,doi:10.1063/1.4726034}, and (2) surface codes with
    finite rate can only achieve an asymptotic minimum distance that is
    logarithmic in \(n\).
    Higher-dimensional manifolds yield distances scaling more favorably.
    Loewner's theorem
    provides an upper bound for any bounded-geometry surface code
    \cite{doi:10.1201/9781420035377-13}.

        Lattice surface codes in \(D\) spatial dimensions can be partially classified by the dimension of their stabilizer generators (and corresponding excitations).
        There are \((p,q)\) \textit{surface codes} for \(p+q=D\) realized by \(Z\)-type stabilizer generators of dimension \(p\) and \(X\)-type stabilizer generators of dimension \(q\).
        The two corresponding types of excitations are of dimension \(p-1\) and \(q-1\), respectively.

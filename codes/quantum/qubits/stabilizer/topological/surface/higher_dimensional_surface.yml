description: |
  Also called the \(D\)\textit{-dimensional surface} or \(D\)\textit{-dimensional toric} code.
  CSS-type extenstion of the Kitaev surface code to arbitrary \(D\)-dimensional manifolds.
  The 4D surface code serves as a self-correcting quantum memory, while surface codes in higher dimensions can have distances not possible in lower dimensions.

  Given a cellulation of a manifold, qubits are put on \(i\)-dimensional faces, \(X\)-type stabilizers
  are associated with \((i-1)\)-faces, while \(Z\)-type stabilizers are associated with \((i+1)\)-faces.

  rate: |
    Rate depends on the underlying cellulation and manifold \cite{arXiv:quant-ph/0110143,arXiv:1606.07116}.
    For general 2D
    manifolds, \(kd^2\leq c(\log k)^2 n\) for some constant \(c\)
    \cite{arXiv:1301.6588}, meaning that (1) 2D surface codes with bounded
    geometry have distance scaling at most as \(O(\sqrt{n})\)
    \cite{arXiv:0909.5200,doi:10.1063/1.4726034}, and (2) surface codes with
    finite rate can only achieve an asymptotic minimum distance that is
    logarithmic in \(n\).
    Higher-dimensional manifolds yield distances scaling more favorably.
    Loewner's theorem
    provides an upper bound for any bounded-geometry surface code
    \cite{doi:10.1201/9781420035377-13}.

      detail: 'The generalized surface code is constructed from chain complexes arising from cell complexes of the underlying manifold. Such complexes are not necessarily products of two non-trivial complexes, but the manifolds are picked so that their homology ensures favorable code properties.'

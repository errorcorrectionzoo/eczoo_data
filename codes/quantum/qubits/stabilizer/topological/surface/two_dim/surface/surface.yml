name: 'Kitaev surface code'
introduced: |
  \cite{doi:10.1070/RM1997v052n06ABEH002155,doi:10.1007/978-1-4615-5923-8_19,arXiv:quant-ph/9707021}

alternative_names:
  - 'Kitaev toric code'

description: |
  A family of Abelian topological \hyperref[code:css]{CSS stabilizer} codes
  whose generators are few-body \(X\)-type and \(Z\)-type Pauli strings
  associated to the stars and plaquettes, respectively, of a cellulation of a
  two-dimensional surface (with a qubit located at each edge of the
  cellulation).
  \textit{Toric code} often either refers to the construction on
  the two-dimensional torus or is an alternative name for the general
  construction.
  The construction on surfaces with boundaries is often called the
  \textit{planar code} \cite{arXiv:quant-ph/9810055,arXiv:quant-ph/9811052,arXiv:1606.07116}.
  Codewords correspond to ground states of the surface code Hamiltonian, and error operators create or annihilate pairs of anyonic charges or vortices.

  The stabilizers of the surface code on the 2-dimensional torus are generated
  by star operators \(A_v\) and plaquette operators \(B_p\).  Each star operator
  is a product of four Pauli-\(X\) operators on the edges adjacent to a vertex
  \(v\) of the lattice; each plaquette operator is a product of four Pauli-\(Z\)
  operators applied to the edges adjacent to a face, or plaquette, \(p\) of the
  lattice (\ref{figure:toric-code-operators}).

  \begin{figure}
    \includegraphics{toric-code-operators}
    \caption{Stabilizer generators and logical operators of the 2D surface
      code on a torus.  The star operators \(A_v\) and the plaquette operators
      \(B_p\) generate the stabilizer group of the toric code.  The logical
      operators are strings that wrap around the torus.}
    \label{figure:toric-code-operators}
  \end{figure}

  The two-dimensional toric code encodes two logical qubits.  We denote by
  \(\overline{X}_i,\overline{Z}_i\) the logical Pauli-\(X\) and Pauli-\(Z\)
  operator of the \(i\)-th logical qubit.  They can are represented by strings
  of Pauli-\(X\) operators or Pauli-\(Z\) operators that wrap around the torus
  as shown in \ref{figure:toric-code-operators}.

protection: |
  Toric code on an \(L\times L\) torus is a \([[2L^2,2,L]]\) CSS code.
  The original planar code on a square-lattice patch with different boundary conditions on the vertical and horizontal edges is a \([[L^2+(L-1)^2,1,L]]\) CSS code \cite{arXiv:quant-ph/9810055}.
  Code size \(k = 2^{2g}\) for a torus of genus \(g\), and such higher genus surfaces have been investigated \cite{arxiv:2307.04418}.

  Coherent physical errors are expected to become incoherent logical errors under syndrome measurement; see corroborating numerical studies performed via the Majorana mapping \cite{arxiv:1710.02270} as well as analytical bounds \cite{arxiv:1912.04319}.

features:
  rate: |
    Both the planar and toric codes saturate the BPT bound, which states that \(k d^2 = O(L^2)\) for codes on a 2D lattice of length \(O(L)\).

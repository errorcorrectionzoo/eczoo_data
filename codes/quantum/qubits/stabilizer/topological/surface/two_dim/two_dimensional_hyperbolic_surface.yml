physical: qubits
logical: qubits

name: 'Two-dimensional hyperbolic surface code'
introduced: '\cite{arXiv:1506.04029}'

description: |
  Hyperbolic surface codes based on a tessellation of a closed 2D manifold with a hyperbolic geometry (i.e., non-Euclidean geometry, e.g., saddle surfaces when defined on a 2D plane).

  For a tessellation involving regular polygons with \( r \) sides and \( s \) polygons meeting at each edge, the number of logical qubits is given by \( k = (1-2/r - 2/s) n + 2 \). Some possible tilings are \( {r,s}: {7,3}, {5,4} \). The weight of the stabilizer generators are dependent on the tiling, with \({5,4}\) having lower weight than \({7,3}\).

#This family of codes describes systems on a closed 2D surface, however, in a physical implementaion the surface would have open boundary conditions. Creating explicit boundaries inhibits the efficiency of the code, reducing the code to a constant distance.
#As with other surface codes, the physical qubits sit on the edges of the tiles and the logical qubits sit at the center of the tile.

protection: 'Protects against Pauli errors with distance \( d \propto \log(n) \). Code parameters are \( [[n, (1-2/r - 2/s)  n + 2, O(\log n) ]] \)'

features:

  rate: 'Two-dimensional hyperbolic surface codes have an asymptotically constant encoding rate \( k/n \) with a distance scaling logarithmically with \( n\) when the surface is closed. The encoding rate depends on the tiling \( {r,s} \) and is given by \( k/n = (1-2/r - 2/s) + 2/n \), which approaches a constant value as the number of physical qubits grows. The weight of the stabilizers is \( r \) for \( Z \)-checks and \( s \) for \( X \)-checks. For open boundary conditions, the code reduces to constant distnace.'

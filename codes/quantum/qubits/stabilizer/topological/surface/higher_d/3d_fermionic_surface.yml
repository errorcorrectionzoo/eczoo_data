description: |
  A non-CSS 3D Kitaev surface code that realizes \(\mathbb{Z}_2\) gauge theory with an emergent fermion, i.e., the fermionic-charge bosonic-loop (FcBl) phase \cite{arxiv:2110.14654}.
  The model can be defined on a cubic lattice in several ways \cite[Eq. (D45-46)]{arxiv:1908.08049}.
  Realizations on other lattices also exist \cite{arxiv:0811.2036}, and the phase of this code also exists in the 3D Kitaev honeycomb model \cite{arxiv:0801.0229}.

  \textit{3D fermionic toric code} often either refers to the construction on the three-dimensional torus or is an alternative name for the general construction.
  The construction on surfaces with boundaries is often called the
  \textit{3D fermionic surface code}.
  However, unlike the 3D surface code, an open (a.k.a. rough) boundary is not possible.
  Twist defects in the form of Kitaev chains can be introduced as in the 2D surface code to store additional logicals \cite{arxiv:1906.01045,arxiv:2208.07367}.

    - '\(CCZ\) and \(CS\) gates can be obtained for the fermionic 3D surface code on certain manifolds by circuits that can be interpreted as moving and spreading lattice realizations of Kitaev chain and \(p+ip\) defects \cite{arxiv:2311.05674}.'

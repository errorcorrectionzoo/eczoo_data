description: |
  A non-CSS 3D Kitaev surface code that realizes \(\mathbb{Z}_2\) gauge theory with an emergent fermion, i.e., the fermionic-charge bosonic-loop (FcBl) phase \cite{arxiv:2110.14654}.
  The model can be defined on a cubic lattice in several ways \cite[Eq. (D45-46)]{arxiv:1908.08049}.
  Realizations on other lattices also exist \cite{arxiv:0801.0229,arxiv:0811.2036}.

  \textit{3D fermionic toric code} often either refers to the construction on the three-dimensional torus or is an alternative name for the general construction.
  The construction on surfaces with boundaries is often called the
  \textit{3D fermionic surface code}.
  However, unlike the 3D surface code, an open (a.k.a. rough) boundary is not possible.
  Twist defects in the form of Kitaev chains can be introduced as in the 2D surface code to store additional logicals \cite{arxiv:1906.01045,arxiv:2208.07367}.

description: |
  A generalization of the Kitaev surface code defined on a 3D lattice.

  \textit{3D toric code} often either refers to the construction on
  the three-dimensional torus or is an alternative name for the general
  construction.
  The construction on surfaces with boundaries is often called the
  \textit{3D planar code}.
  There exists a rotated version of the 3D surface code, the \textit{3D rotated surface code}, akin to the (2D) rotated surface code \cite{arxiv:2211.02116}.
  The \textit{welded surface code} \cite{arxiv:1406.4227} consists of several 3D surface codes stitched together in a way that the distance scales faster than the linear size of the system.

  Related models \cite{arxiv:cond-mat/0607736,arxiv:1012.0859} on lattices with certain colorability are equivalent to several copies of the 3D surface code \cite{arxiv:1908.08049}.


protection: |
  The planar 3D surface code family on a cubic lattice of length \(L\) has parameters \([[2L(L-1)^2+L^3,1,d_X=L^2,d_Z=L]]\), while the 3D toric code has parameters \([[3L^3,3,d_X=L^2,d_Z=L]]\).

  Stability against Hamiltonian perturbations was determined using a tensor-network representation \cite{arxiv:2012.15346}. The phase diagram of the perturbed tensor network maps to that of a 3D Ising gauge theory.

#  The \textit{Kirigami code} \cite{} consists of three copies of the 3D surface code.

#protection: As a stabilizer code, \([[n=O(d^2), k=O(1), d]]\).

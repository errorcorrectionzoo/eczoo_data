name: 'Kitaev surface code'
introduced: |
  \cite{doi:10.1070/RM1997v052n06ABEH002155,doi:10.1007/978-1-4615-5923-8_19,arxiv:quant-ph/9707021,arxiv:quant-ph/9811052}


description: |
  A family of Abelian topological \hyperref[code:css]{CSS stabilizer} codes
  whose generators are few-body \(X\)-type and \(Z\)-type Pauli strings
  associated to the stars and plaquettes, respectively, of a cellulation of a
  two-dimensional surface (with a qubit located at each edge of the
  cellulation).
  Codewords correspond to ground states of the surface code Hamiltonian, and error operators create or annihilate pairs of anyonic charges or vortices.

  The construction on closed surfaces (surfaces with boundaries) is called the toric code (\textit{planar code} \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/9810055,arxiv:quant-ph/9811052}).
  There are two types of stabilizers one can put on edges, yielding \textit{open} (a.k.a. rough or primal) and \textit{closed} (a.k.a. smooth or dual) boundaries.
  A \textit{mixed boundary} consists of an interleaving of the two stabilizer types \cite{arxiv:1606.07116}.

protection: |
  The original planar code on a square-lattice patch with different boundary conditions on the vertical and horizontal edges is a \([[L^2+(L-1)^2,1,L]]\) CSS code \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/9810055}.
  Code size \(k = 2^{2g}\) for a torus of genus \(g\), and such higher genus surfaces have been investigated \cite{arxiv:2307.04418}.

  \subsection{Topological order and gauge-theory analogy}
  When treated as ground states of the code Hamiltonian, the code states realize \(\mathbb{Z}_2\) topological order, a topological phase of matter that also exists in \(\mathbb{Z}_2\) lattice gauge theory \cite{doi:10.1063/1.1665530}.
  This order does not persist at nonzero temperature \cite{arxiv:1106.6026,arxiv:2310.08639}.

  Pauli noise operators can be organized into anyonic strings of the gauge theory, which cause excitations of the ground-state subspace.
  The inability of local errors to distinguish the codewords translates to the "topologically protected" degeneracy of the ground state, rigorously formulated by the \hyperref[topic:tqo]{TQO-1 condition}.
  The joint \(+1\)-eigenspace of the \(Z\)-type Paulis corresponds to the subspace that conserves \(\mathbb{Z}_2\) flux, while the joint \(+1\)-eigenspace of \(X\)-type operators corresponds to the subspace that preserves \(\mathbb{Z}_2\) gauge symmetry (a one-form symmetry).
  Logical Pauli operators correspond to non-contractible Wilson loops in the case of closed boundaries, and to paths connecting different types of boundaries in the case of open boundaries.

  Behavior under Hamiltonian \(X\)-type and \(Z\)-type perturbations is related to an anisotropic 3D gauge Higgs model \cite{arxiv:0804.3175,arxiv:1411.5815}.
  In order to corrupt logical states, any local noise must bring the code state out of the topological order \cite{arxiv:2310.08639}.

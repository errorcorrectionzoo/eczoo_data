description: |
  Version of the Kitaev surface code on the two-dimensional torus, encoding two logical qubits.
  Being the first manifestation of the surface code, "toric code" is often an alternative name for the general construction.
  \textit{Twisted toric code} \cite[Fig. 8]{arxiv:2012.09271} refers to the construction on a torus with twisted (a.k.a. shifted) boundary conditions.

  The stabilizers of the toric code are generated
  by star operators \(A_v\) and plaquette operators \(B_p\).
  Each star operator is a product of four Pauli-\(X\) operators on the edges adjacent to a vertex   \(v\) of the lattice; each plaquette operator is a product of four Pauli-\(Z\) operators applied to the edges adjacent to a face, or plaquette, \(p\) of the
  lattice (\ref{figure:toric-code-operators}).

  \begin{figure}
    \includegraphics{toric-code-operators}
    \caption{Stabilizer generators and logical operators of the toric code.
      The star operators \(A_v\) and the plaquette operators
      \(B_p\) generate the stabilizer group.  The logical
      operators are strings that wrap around the torus.}
    \label{figure:toric-code-operators}
  \end{figure}

  We denote by
  \(\overline{X}_i,\overline{Z}_i\) the logical Pauli-\(X\) and Pauli-\(Z\)
  operator of the \(i\)-th logical qubit (with \(i\in\{1,2\}\)).  They are represented by strings of Pauli-\(X\) operators or Pauli-\(Z\) operators that wrap around the torus, as shown in \ref{figure:toric-code-operators}.

protection: |
  Toric code on an \(L\times L\) torus is a \([[2L^2,2,L]]\) CSS code.

  Coherent physical errors are expected to become incoherent logical errors under syndrome measurement; see corroborating numerical studies performed via the Majorana mapping \cite{arxiv:1710.02270} as well as analytical bounds \cite{arxiv:1912.04319}.

features:
  encoders:
    - 'Lindbladian-based dissipative encoding for the toric code \cite{arxiv:1310.1036} that does not give a speedup relative to circuit-based encoders \cite{arxiv:1310.1037}.'

  transversal_gates:
    - 'Transversal logical Pauli gates correspond to Pauli strings on non-trivial loops of the torus.'

  code_capacity_threshold:
    - 'Independent \(X,Z\) noise: \(p_X = 10.31\%\) under MWPM decoding \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/0207088} (see also Ref. \cite{arxiv:1405.4883}), \(9.9\%\) under BP-OSD decoding \cite{arxiv:2005.07016}, and \(8.9\%\) under GBP decoding \cite{arxiv:2212.03214}.
    The threshold under ML decoding corresponds to the value of a critical point of a two-dimensional random-bond Ising model (RBIM) on the Nishimori line \cite{doi:10.1143/JPSJ.55.3305,arxiv:quant-ph/0110143}, calculated to be \(10.94 \pm 0.02\%\) in Ref. \cite{arxiv:cond-mat/0010143}, \(10.93(2)\%\) in Ref. \cite{arxiv:cond-mat/0106023}, \(10.9187\%\) in Ref. \cite{arxiv:0811.0464}, \(10.917(3)\%\) in Ref. \cite{arxiv:0811.2101}, \(10.939(6)\%\) in Ref. \cite{arxiv:0902.4153}, and estimated to be between \(10.9\%\) and \(11\%\) in Ref. \cite{arxiv:1405.4883}.
    Above values are for one type of noise only, and the ML threshold for combined \(X\) and \(Z\) noise is \(2p_X - p_X^2 \approx 20.6\%\).'
    - 'Depolarizing noise: between \(17\%\) and \(18.5\%\) under BSV tensor-network decoding \cite{arxiv:1405.4883}, \(14\%\) under GBP decoding \cite{arxiv:2212.03214}, \(16.5\%\) under recursive MWPM \cite{arxiv:2212.11632}, between \(16\%\) and \(17.5\%\) under AMBP4 (depending on whether surface or toric code is considered) \cite{arxiv:2104.13659}, and between \(15\%\) and \(16\%\) under RG \cite{arxiv:0911.0581}, Markov-chain \cite{arxiv:1302.2669}, or MWPM \cite{arxiv:0905.0531} decoding.
    The threshold under ML decoding corresponds to the value of a critical point of the disordered eight-vertex Ising model, calculated to be \(18.9(3)\%\) \cite{arxiv:1202.1852} (see also APS Physics viewpoint \cite{doi:10.1103/Physics.5.50}).'
    - 'Erasure noise: \(50\%\) for square tiling \cite{arxiv:0904.3556,arxiv:0912.1159}.
    There is an inverse relationship between coordination number of the syndrome graph, with the threshold corresponding to a percolation transition \cite{arxiv:1810.09621}.'
    - 'Correlated noise: \(10.04(6)\%\) under mildly correlated bit-flip noise \cite{arxiv:1809.10704}.'
    # The latter work considers \(X\)-type noise only, but this is equivalent since \(X\)- and \(Z\)-type noise is corrected independently.
    - 'The toric code has a \hyperref[topic:measurement-threshold]{measurement threshold} of one \cite{arxiv:2402.00145}.'
    - 'Coherent noise: the threshold under ML decoding corresponds to the value of a critical point of a particular random-bond Ising model (RBIM) called the complex-coupled Ashkin-Teller model \cite{arxiv:2410.22436,arxiv:2411.05785}.'

  threshold:
    - 'The threshold under ML decoding with measurement errors corresponds to the value of a critical point of a three-dimensional random plaquette model \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/0110143,arxiv:quant-ph/0207088}.'
    - '\(0.133\%\) for independent \(X,Z\) noise and faulty syndrome measurements using a cellular automaton decoder \cite{arxiv:1609.00510}.'

    One cycle of syndrome readout on 19-qubit planar and 24-qubit toric codes realized in two-dimensional Rydberg atomic arrays \cite{arxiv:2112.03923}.

name: '2D hyperbolic surface code'

description: |
  Hyperbolic surface codes based on a tessellation of a closed 2D manifold with a hyperbolic geometry (i.e., non-Euclidean geometry, e.g., saddle surfaces when defined on a 2D plane).

  For a tessellation involving regular polygons with \( r \) sides and \( s \) polygons meeting at each edge, the number of logical qubits is given by \( k = (1-2/r - 2/s) n + 2 \).
  Some possible tilings are \( \{r,s\}: \{7,3\}, \{5,4\} \).
  The weight of the stabilizer generators are dependent on the tiling, with \(\{5,4\}\) having lower weight than \(\{7,3\}\).

  A \textit{semi-hyperbolic surface code} \cite{arxiv:1703.00590} is a code defined on a \(\{4,s\}\) tiling, but where each square is replaced with a square region of a 2D lattice.

#This family of codes describes systems on a closed 2D surface, however, in a physical implementaion the surface would have open boundary conditions. Creating explicit boundaries inhibits the efficiency of the code, reducing the code to a constant distance.
#As with other surface codes, the physical qubits sit on the edges of the tiles and the logical qubits sit at the center of the tile.

protection: 'Protects against Pauli errors with distance \( d \propto \log(n) \). Code parameters are \( [[n, (1-2/r - 2/s)  n + 2, O(\log n) ]] \)'

features:

  rate: '2D hyperbolic surface codes have an asymptotically constant encoding rate \( k/n \) with a distance scaling logarithmically with \( n\) when the surface is closed. The encoding rate depends on the tiling \( {r,s} \) and is given by \( k/n = (1-2/r - 2/s) + 2/n \), which approaches a constant value as the number of physical qubits grows. The weight of the stabilizers is \( r \) for \( Z \)-checks and \( s \) for \( X \)-checks. For open boundary conditions, the code reduces to constant distnace.'

  threshold:
    - '1\(\%\) - 5\(\%\) for a \({5,4}\) tiling under minimum-weight decoding \cite{arxiv:1208.2317}. For larger tilings, the lower bound on the distance decreases, suggesting the threshold will also decrease.'

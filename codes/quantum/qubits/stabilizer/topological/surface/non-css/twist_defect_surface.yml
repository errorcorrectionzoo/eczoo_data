code_id: twist_defect_surface
physical: qubits
logical: qubits

name: 'Twist-defect surface code'
introduced: |
  \cite{arxiv:1004.1838,arxiv:1612.04795,arxiv:1806.02820,arxiv:2101.09349}

alternative_names:
  - 'Surface code with a twist'

description: |
  A non-CSS extension of the 2D surface-code construction whose non-CSS stabilizer generators are associated with twist defects of the associated lattice.

  For lattices with dislocations and rotational disclinations, twist-defect stabilizer generators are placed at the location of the dislocations to yield a stabilizer code whose logical dimension depends on the defects.
  A simple example is a surface code on a lattice with a single lattice dislocation which hosts a weight-five non-CSS twist-defect stabilizer generator \cite[Fig. 2]{arxiv:1004.1838}.

  More generally, given a graph embedded in a 2D manifold, qubits are placed on vertices, stabilizers on faces, and twist defects are associated to odd-degree vertices.


protection: |
  Code properties depends on the number and size of the twist defects.

features:
  rate: 'Twist-defect surface codes have negative curvature around their defects, and thus circumvent the \hyperref[topic:BPT-bound]{BPT bound} for codes on Euclidean lattices.'

  general_gates:
    - |
      Clifford gates can be implemented via twist-based lattice surgery \cite{arxiv:2201.05678} or braiding defects
      \cite{arxiv:0704.2540,arxiv:1004.1838,arXiv:1104.5047,arXiv:1208.0928,arXiv:1508.04166,arXiv:1609.04673,arXiv:2103.08381}.

realizations:
  - |
    Ground state of the toric code has been implemented with and without twists, and the non-Abelian braiding behavior of the twists, which realize Ising anyons, has been demonstrated \cite{arxiv:2211.09802}.

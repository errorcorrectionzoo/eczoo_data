description: |
  A non-CSS extension of the 2D surface-code construction whose non-CSS stabilizer generators are associated with twist defects of the associated lattice.
  A related construction \cite{arxiv:2406.09951} doubles the number of qubits in the lattice via \hyperref[topic:symplectic-doubling]{symplectic doubling}.

  For lattices with dislocations and rotational disclinations, twist-defect stabilizer generators are placed at the location of the dislocations to yield a stabilizer code whose logical dimension depends on the defects.
  Logical dimension is determined by the genus of the underlying surface (for closed surfaces), types of boundaries (for open surfaces), and any twist defects present.

  A simple example is a surface code on a lattice with a single lattice dislocation which hosts a weight-five non-CSS twist-defect stabilizer generator \cite[Fig. 2]{arxiv:1004.1838}.
  More generally, given a graph embedded in a 2D manifold, qubits are placed on vertices, stabilizers on faces, and twist defects are associated to odd-degree vertices.


protection: |
  Code properties depends on the number and size of the twist defects.

features:
  rate: 'Twist-defect surface codes have negative curvature around their defects, and thus circumvent the \hyperref[topic:bpt-bound]{BPT bound} for codes on Euclidean lattices.'

  general_gates:
    - |
      \hyperref[topic:clifford]{Clifford gates} can be implemented via twist-based lattice surgery \cite{arxiv:2201.05678} or braiding twist defects
      \cite{arxiv:0704.2540,arxiv:1004.1838,arxiv:1104.5047,arxiv:1208.0928,arxiv:1508.04166,arxiv:1609.04673,arxiv:2103.08381}.

realizations:
  - |
    Ground state of the toric code has been implemented with and without twists, and the non-Abelian braiding behavior of the twists, which realize Ising anyons, has been demonstrated \cite{arxiv:2211.09802}.

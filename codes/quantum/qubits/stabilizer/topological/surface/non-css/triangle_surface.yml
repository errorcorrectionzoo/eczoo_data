# # triangle codes of (odd) distance d use 3d
# 2/4 + 1/4 data
# qubits per logical qubit,

description: |
  A surface code with weight-four stabilizer generators defined on a triangular lattice patch that are examples of twist-defect surface code with a single twist defect at the center of the patch.
  The codes use about \(25\%\) fewer physical per logical qubit for a given distance compared to the surface code.

  Triangular surface codes are defined on a plane tiled with equilateral triangles.
  The size of the triangular patches and which patch encodes data versus act as ancillas for gates depends on the initialization and measurement procedures.
  See Ref. \cite{arXiv:1612.04795} for tables and figures.

# Each triangle can encode a qubit where one side is a string of \(Z\)s as logical \(\bar{Z}\), one side is a string of \(X\)s as logical \(\bar{X}\), and the last side is a mixed-type string as logical \(\bar{Y}\).
#
#
# The codes have simple syndrome extraction circuits and have a high threshold close to that of surface codes.
#
# The twist is a check of weight five that is embedded into the lattice of the code.
# For the triangle codes, the modified twist defects have weight four checks.
# Triangle codes also

  For a triangle code with 7 qubits of information, 6 (6, 8) ancilla qubits, 13 (13, 15) qubits in total, and max degree of 4 (5, 4), the lower pseudothreshold under depolarizing noise is \(1.05 \times 10^{-4}\) (\(1.57 \times 10^{-4}\), \(1.76 \times 10^{-4}\)), and the upper pseudothreshold is \(1.22 \times 10^{-4}\) (\(1.92 \times 10^{-4}\), \(2.23 \times 10^{-4}\)).


features:
  rate: 'For specific triangle codes, the rates are \(7/13\) or \(7/15\) both with distance \(3\) and weight-four check operators.
  In general, for \(d\) distance, there are \(3d^2 + O(d)\), \(9d^2/4 + O(d)\), or \(6d^2/4 + O(d)\) physical qubits per logical qubit, depending on the type of initialization and measurement procedures.'

  encoders:
    - 'Code conversion (CC) initialization and measurement method, in which the surface code is used to hold data between gates in patches.'
    #
    # To initialize a state in a distance \(2d+1\) code can be done by initializing a \(d \times d\) surface code patch and then extending the patch from a corner.
    # Ancilla qubits are prepared in the \(|+\rangle\) or \(|0\rangle\) basis.
    # Then the triangle code stabilizers are measured \(O(d)\) times.
    # In figure 3 in \cite{arXiv:1612.04795}, the product of dashed loops and solid loops make a plaquette in the triangle code.
    # So this converts from the surface code where initialization and measurement is well-known to the triangle code.
    # Since this procudure is heavily based on the surface code, storing data with distance at least \(d\) can be stored without converting to triangle patches. However
    - 'Basis-state conversion (BC) initialization and measurement method in which one initializes and then measures a logical Pauli eigenstate.
    To do this, triangle ancilla qubits are required outside of the triangle patches that hold the data.
    That is, the ancilla patches must be empty of data and be adjacent to the side that contains the logical Pauli that needs to be measured or initialized.'
# The method uses fewer qubits than the CC method to convert a basis state from the surface code to the triangle code. It also uses fewer qubits than the CC method to measure the basis-state transversally. This method preps a basis state in a \(d \times d\) surface code as the CC method except now instead of treating the surface code as \(1/3\) of a triangle patch, it is \(2/3\). To convert to the surface code, stop measuring the bottom loop operators of the patch and measure the stabilizers of a \((d+1)/2 \times (d+1)/2 \times d\) triangle code \(O(d)\) times. Then, symmetrize the triangle code by measuring the stabilizers and not measuring the stabilizers in the topmost rows.
    - 'The CAT states (CS) initialization and measurement method uses a row of \(d\) ancilla qubits along some edge of a triangle code with distance \(d\) to create and verify a GHz state that is used to measure the logical operator along the same edge.
    Creating this GHz state takes \(O(d)\) time steps.
    To relaibly measure the logical state, the GHz state must be measured \(O(d)\) times, resuling in \(O(d^2)\) time for logical measurement.
    Initialization is a similar procedure that requires \(O(d^2)\) time for logical-operator measurements that occur \(O(d)\) times as well as \(O(d^2)\) time to project the code onto a logical state \cite{arXiv:1612.04795}.'

  transversal_gates: 'Triangle codes admit transversal order-three single-qubit Clifford gates, e.g., \(\bar{SH}\) \cite{arXiv:1612.04795}.'
# that performs \(H\) on all qubit positions \(x > 0\) or at \(x = 0\) and \(z > 0\) and then perform \(SH\) on the central qubit.
# Note that qubits are placed on integer lattics in the \(xy-, yz-,\) and \(xz-\) planes \cite{arXiv:1612.04795}.'

  general_gates:
    - 'Performing single-qubit Clifford gates using the CC procedure requires surface code patches to be embedded in triangle patches.
    This procedure requires \(O(d)\) Clifford gate times for \(H,S,CNOT\) \cite{arXiv:1612.04795}.'
    - 'The BC procedure requires \(O(1)\) time to perform \(H,S\) gates and \(O(d)\) time to perform \(CNOT\).
    Sometimes reorientation of the sides is required, and that takes \(O(d)\) to perform \cite{arXiv:1612.04795}.'

  decoders:
    - 'The decoding uses a a single decoding graph since the triangle code is not a CSS code.
    Nodes of the graph are located at each stabilizer (center of the triangle graph) and have red or blue edges, where red associates with \(X\) errors and blue with \(Z\) errors.
    To take into account any errors from measuring the error syndrome, a three-dimensional stack of the decoding graphs is laid on top of the code with vertical edges connecting to qubits between layers \cite{arXiv:1612.04795}.'

  fault_tolerance:
    - 'The symmetry of triangle codes allows for fault-tolerant measurement and encoding in any Pauli basis \cite{arXiv:1612.04795}.'
    - 'A non-fault-tolerant curcuit initializes the triangle code.
    To guarantee fault-tolerance, postselection is performed on trivial measurements of the syndrome and of the logical Pauli, depending on the basis of the logical states \cite{arXiv:1612.04795}.'
    - 'Making syndrome extraction fault tolerant requires a specific ordering of syndrome measurements so as to avoid hook errors \cite{arXiv:1612.04795}.'

# , instead of using the conventional ordering of coupling to the loop after coupling to the plaquette, the extraction has the coupling to the loop interwoven with the coupling to the plaquette.
# These are equivalent in circuits, but makes a difference to the fault-tolerance since the latter can detect hook errors and the former cannot

  code_capacity_threshold:
    - '\(10\%\) under either bit-flip or bit-phase noise for ideal syndrome measurements.
    The decoder used is a decoding graph with the same weight assigned to each edge, and Dijkstra''s algorithm is used to computre the total weight of any path \cite{arXiv:1612.04795}.'

  threshold:
    - '\(3.2\%\) bit-flip error-correction threshold for noisy syndrome measurements and \(2.6\%\) for bit-phase flip noise.
    The decoder used is a decoding graph as describe above \cite{arXiv:1612.04795}.'
    - 'In general, the triangular surface code has a threshold of similar magnitude to the toric code for uncorrelated \(X\) and \(Z\) errors.
    For correlated errors, the triangle code has a lower threshold of a factor of about \(36\) \cite{arXiv:1612.04795}.'

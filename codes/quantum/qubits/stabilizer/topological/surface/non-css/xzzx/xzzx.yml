name: 'XZZX surface code'
introduced: '\cite{arxiv:quant-ph/0205004,arxiv:1108.5490,arxiv:1201.3757,arxiv:2009.07851}'

alternative_names:
  - 'Wen plaquette model'

description: |
  Non-CSS variant of the rotated surface code whose generators are \(XZZX\) Pauli strings associated, clock-wise, to the vertices of each face of a two-dimensional lattice (with a qubit located at each vertex of the tessellation).

  \textit{XZZX toric code} often either refers to the construction on the two-dimensional torus or is an alternative name for the general construction.
  \textit{Twisted XZZX toric code} refers to the construction on a torus with twisted (a.k.a. shifted) boundary conditions.
  The construction on surfaces with boundaries is often called the
  \textit{XZZX planar code}.

  Stabilizer generators for this code are shown in \ref{figure:xzzx-operators}.
  \begin{figure}
    \includegraphics{xzzx}
    \caption{
    Stabilizer generators of a XZZX planar code with open boundaries.
    The generators are \(XZZX\) operators on the corners of squares in the bulk and \(XZ\) operators on the boundaries.
    }

protection: As a stabilizer code, \([[n=O(d^2), k=O(1), d]]\).

features:
  decoders:
    - 'MWPM decoder, which can be used for \(X\) and \(Z\) noise.
    For \(Y\) noise, a variant of the matching decoder could be used like it is used for the XY code in Ref. \cite{arxiv:1907.02554}.
    Decoding complexity scales as \hyperref[topic:asymptotics]{order} \(O(n^3)\) because the code is non-CSS \cite[Supplement]{arxiv:1907.02554}\cite{arxiv:2202.06612}.'
  code_capacity_threshold:
    - 'For large but finite \(X\)- or \(Z\)-biased noise, the code''s thresholds exceed the zero-rate hashing bound.  The difference of the threshold from the hashing bound exceeds \(2.9\%\) at a \(Z\) or \(X\) bias of 300.'
    - '\(50\%\) threshold for noise infinitely biased towards \(X\) or \(Y\) or \(Z\) errors using a maximum-likelihood decoder.'
    - 'Depolarizing noise: \(18.7(1)\%\) under tensor-network decoder \cite{arxiv:1708.08474} and \(17.5\%\) under AMBP4 \cite{arxiv:2104.13659}.'
  threshold:
    - '\(\approx 4.5\%\) using minimum-weight perfect matching decoder for depolarizing noise (bias \(\eta=0.5\)); \(\approx 10\%\) for infinite \(Z\) bias.'
    - '\(4.15\%\) when \(98\%\) of depolarizing errors are converted into erasure errors with union-find decoder on a planar code, vs. \(0.937\%\) for pure depolarizing noise.
    The dominant source of noise in neutral atom arrays is spontaneous decay into detectable energy levels outside of the computational subspace.
    Since that decay occurs in a Rydberg level that is accessible from only of the hyperfine states used for storage, the resulting channel is biased erasure \cite{arxiv:2201.03540}.'
    - '\(0.817\%\) and \(0.940\%\) with minimum-weight perfect matching and belief-matching decoder, respectively, for biased circuit-level noise \cite{arxiv:2203.04948}.'

realizations:
  - |
    Superconducting circuits: Distance-five 25-qubit code implemented on a superconducting quantum processor by Google Quantum AI \cite{arxiv:2207.06431}.
    This code outperformed the average of several instances of the smaller distance-three nine-qubit \(XZZX\) variant of the \hyperref[code:surface-17]{surface-17} code realized on the same device, both in terms of logical error probability over 25 cycles and in terms of logical error per cycle.
    This increase in error-correcting capabilities while using more physical qubits supports the notion of an error threshold.
    Braiding of defects has been demonstrated for the distance-five code \cite{arxiv:2210.10255}. Leakage errors have been handled in a separate work in a distance-three code \cite{arxiv:2211.04728}.
    Google Quantum AI follow-up experiment realizing distance-5 and distance-7 codes with 100 rounds of correction using the Libra and transformer-based decoders. The logical error rate is suppressed by a factor of \(\approx 2\), demonstrating beyond-break-even error correction with a block quantum code \cite{arxiv:2408.13687}.
    Magic-state cultivation was demonstrated on a device by Google Quantum AI by code switching between a distance-three 6.6.6 color code and distance-five \(XZZX\) surface code and decoding with the Tesseract decoder \cite{arxiv:2512.13908}.
  - 'Neutral atom arrays: Lukin group. Transversal CNOT gates performed on distance \(3\), \(5\), and \(7\) codes \cite{arxiv:2312.03982}. Below-threshold performance on distance \(3\) and \(5\) codes with multiple rounds of syndrome extraction and error correction \cite{arxiv:2506.20661}.'


notes:
  - 'A single \(X\) or \(Z\) error gives rise to two nearby defects, which can be viewed as endpoints of a string. That way, multiple \(Z\) errors can be decomposed into a combination of diagonal strings.'
  - Originally formulated as an example of \(\mathbb{Z}_2\) topological order in the Wen plaquette model \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/0205004}.

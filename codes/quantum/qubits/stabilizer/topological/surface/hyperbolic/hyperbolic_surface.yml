code_id: hyperbolic_surface
physical: qubits
logical: qubits

name: 'Hyperbolic surface code'

description: |
  An extension of the Kitaev surface code construction to hyperbolic manifolds.
  Given a cellulation of a manifold, qubits are put on \(i\)-dimensional faces, \(X\)-type stabilizers are associated with \((i-1)\)-faces, while \(Z\)-type stabilizers are associated with \(i+1\)-faces.
  
protection: 'Constructions (see code children below) have yielded distances scaling favorably with the number of qubits. The use of hyperbolic surfaces allows one to circumvent bounds on code parameters (such as the \term{BPT bound}) that are valid for lattice geometries.'

features:
  general_gates:
    - '\((1,D-1)\) surface codes on hyperbolic geometries admit a fault-tolerant implementation of \(C^D Z\) gates \cite{arxiv:2312.09111}.'
    - 'Higher-dimensional hyperbolic surface codes can admit a cup product structure and can thus have logical gates in the \term{Clifford hierarchy} implemented by constant-depth \hyperref[topic:clifford]{Clifford circuits} \cite{arxiv:2410.16250}.'

  decoders:
    - 'Hastings decoder \cite{arxiv:1312.2546}.'

  parents:
    - code_id: higher_dimensional_surface
  cousins:
    - code_id: holographic_tensor
      detail: 'Both holographic tensor-network and hyperbolic surface codes utilize tesselations of hyperbolic surfaces.
      Encodings for the former are hyperbolically tiled tensor networks, while the latter is defined on hyperbolically tiled physical-qubit lattices.'
    - code_id: single_shot
      detail: 'A 4D hyperbolic surface code can be decoded with the Hastings decoder \cite{arxiv:1312.2546} in time \(O(n\log n)\) and with a logical error scaling inverse polynomially with \(n\).'

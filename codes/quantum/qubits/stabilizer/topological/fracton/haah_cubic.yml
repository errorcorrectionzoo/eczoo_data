physical: qubits
logical: qubits

name: 'Haah cubic code'
introduced: '\cite{arXiv:1101.1962}'

description: |
  Class of stabilizer codes on a length-\(L\) cubic lattice with one or two qubits per site. We also require that the stabilizer group \(\mathsf{S}\) is translation invariant and generated by two types of operators with support on a cube.

  In the non-CSS case, these two are related by spatial inversion. For CSS codes, we require that the product of all corner operators is the identity. We lastly require that there are no non-trival ''string operators'', meaning that single-site operators are a phase, and any period one logical operator \(l \in \mathsf{S}^{\perp}\) is just a phase.

  Haah showed in his original construction that there is exactly one non-CSS code of this form, and 17 CSS codes \cite{arXiv:1101.1962}. The non-CSS code is labeled code 0, and the rest are numbered from 1 - 17. Codes 1-4, 7, 8, and 10 do not have string logical operators \cite{arXiv:1101.1962,arXiv:1908.08049}.
  Encodings using geometries with boundaries as well as lattice defects have been studied \cite{arxiv:2308.00138}.

  Straightforward generalizations of the above codes exist to modular qudits, oscillators, and rotors \cite{manual:{J. Haah, Two generalizations of the cubic code model, \href{https://online.kitp.ucsb.edu/online/qinfo_c17/haah/}{KITP Conference: Frontiers of Quantum Information Physics, UCSB, Santa Barbara, CA.}},arXiv:1709.04460}.
#(\(l_{\infty}\) metric)

protection: 'Cubic codes protect against simultaneous independent Pauli errors on different sites (not qubits, since there can be 2 qubits per site). Codes 0-4 are known to have distance \(d \ge L\), meaning they can achieve macroscopic code distance as \(L\to\infty\).'

features:
  threshold:
    - 'The encoding rate depends on the code implemented, but code 0 has been shown to have \(k \ge L\) (on a periodic finite cubic lattice of side length \(L\). In general we expect the number of logical bits to scale as \(k \sim L\).'

#notes:
#  - 'A relation \(k d = O(L^3) \) between code parameters on 3D lattices \cite{arXiv:0909.5200}, meaning that we must have fewer qubits per site \(m\) than types of generator \(t\), since if \(t < m\) then \(d = O(1)\).'

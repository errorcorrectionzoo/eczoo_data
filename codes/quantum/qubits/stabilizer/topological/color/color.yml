introduced: '\cite{arxiv:quant-ph/0605138,arxiv:cond-mat/0607736}'
# not a lattice code because can be defined on general graph

description: |
  Member of a family of qubit CSS codes defined on particular \(D\)-dimensional graphs.

  One family is defined on a \(D\)-dimensional graph which satisfies two properties: (1) the graph is a homogeneous simplicial \(D\)-complex obtained as a triangulation of the interior of a \(D\)-simplex, and (2) the graph is \(D+1\)-colorable.
  Qubits are placed on the \(D\)-simplices and generators are supported on suitable simplices \cite{arxiv:1311.0277,arxiv:1410.0069,doi:10.7907/059V-MG69}.
  Admissible graphs can be obtained via a fattening procedure \cite{arxiv:cond-mat/0607736}.
  See also a construction based on the more general quantum pin codes \cite{arxiv:1906.11394}.


# For 2-dimensional color code, the lattice must be such that it is 3-valent and has 3-colorable faces, such as a honeycomb tiling.
# The qubits are placed on the vertices and two stabilizer generators are placed on each face \cite{arxiv:1311.0277}.

  As with the surface code, the code distance depends on the specific kind of lattice used to define the code. More precisely, the distance depends on the homology of logical string operators \cite{arxiv:1311.0277}.


features:
  transversal_gates:
    - 'Some color codes on \(D\)-dimensional lattices can transversally implement a gate at the \((D-1)\)st level of the \term{Clifford hierarchy} in the form of a \(Z\)-rotation by angle \(-\pi/2^D\) \cite[Fig. 3]{arxiv:1410.0069}.'
  decoders:
    - 'In contrast to the surface code, the color code can suffer from unremovable \hyperref[topic:effective-distance]{hook errors} due to the specifics of its syndrome extraction circuits.
    Fault-tolerant decoders thus have to utilize additional flag qubits.'
  fault_tolerance:
    - 'The 6D color code is a self-correcting quantum memory and admits fault-tolerant universal gate set in 7D \cite{arxiv:0907.5228}.'

notes:
  - 'See Ref. \cite{arxiv:1311.0277} for an overview of color codes.'

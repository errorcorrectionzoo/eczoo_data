physical: qubits
logical: qubits

name: 'Two-dimensional color code'
short_name: '2D color code'
introduced: '\cite{arxiv:quant-ph/0605138}'

description: |
  Two-dimensional version of the color code, defined on a two-dimensional trivalent planar graph with 3-colorable faces.
  Each face hosts two stabilizer generators, a Pauli-\(X\) and a Pauli-\(Z\) string acting on all the qubits of the face.


  String operators are defined on the paths along the edges of the qubit.
  These paths can have branching points. Each path has two string operators, one corresponding to the \(X\) basis and one corresponding to the \(Z\) basis.
  In correspondence with the coloring of the lattice faces, string operators also come in three colors.
  String operators commute or anti-commute. They anti-commute when they cross an odd number of times and have a different color and type. String operators correspond to encoded \(X\) or \(Z\) operators when they are closed and not boundaries.

  As CSS codes, variants of the 2D color code are constructed out of self-dual codes on cubic planar graphs \cite{doi:10.1016/0095-8956(91)90066-S}.

  #   The plaquette operators generate the stabilizer group of the toric code where each face corresponds to an X or Z plaquette operator.  The string operators
  #   are pairs of X and Z logical operators that wrap around the torus. There are only four independent string operators, so there are two independent colors for the string operators \cite{arXiv:1311.0277}.}

features:
  rate: 'For general 2D manifolds, \(kd^2 \leq c(\log k)^2 n\) for some constant \(c\) in what can be thought of as an extension of the \hyperref[topic:BPT-bound]{BPT bound} to codes on hyperbolic geometries \cite{arXiv:1301.6588}, meaning that color codes with finite rate can only achieve an asymptotic minimum distance that is logarithmic in \(n\).'

description: |
  An \(((n,2^k,d))\) qubit stabilizer code is denoted as \([[n,k]]\) or \([[n,k,d]]\), where \(d\) is the code's distance.
  Logical subspace is the joint eigenspace of commuting Pauli operators forming the code's stabilizer group \(\mathsf{S}\).
  Traditionally, the logical subspace is the joint \(+1\) eigenspace of a set of \(2^{n-k}\) commuting Pauli operators which do not contain \(-I\).
  The distance is the minimum weight of a Pauli string that implements a nontrivial logical operation in the code.

  Qubit stabilizer codes are defined by a stabilizer group \(\mathsf{S}\), a group of commuting Paulis that does not contain the identity and is generated by \(r=n-k\) generators.
  The table below summarizes the relevant groups and their sizes for a qubit stabilizer code.
    \begin{table}
      \begin{cells}
      \celldata<c H, c H, c H>{purpose & symbol & size}
      \celldata<c, c, c>{
      stabilizer group & \(\mathsf{S}\) & \(2^{n-k}\)
          \\
      code-preserving Paulis & \(\mathsf{N}(\mathsf{S})\) & \(4\cdot 2^{n+k}\)
          \\
      logical Paulis & \(\mathsf{N}(\mathsf{S})/\mathsf{S}\) & \(4^{k}\)
      }
      \end{cells}
      \caption{Groups relevant to qubit stabilizer codes. The normalizer \(\mathsf{N}(\mathsf{S})\) (technically, the centralizer, but these are equivalent for this case) is the group formed by all elements of the \(n\)-qubit Pauli group that commute with all elements in \(\mathsf{S}\). The normalizer is defined so as to include \(i\) and its powers as elements, while the stabilizer group is not.}
      \label{table:stabilizer-groups}
    \end{table}

  \begin{defterm}{Symplectic representation}
  \label{topic:binary-symplectic-representation}
  In the symplectic representation, the single-qubit identity, \(X\), \(Y\), or \(Z\) Pauli matrices represented using two bits as \((0|0)\), \((1|0)\), \((1|1)\), and \((0|1)\), respectively.
  In other words, the single-qubit Pauli string \(X^a Z^b\) is converted to the vector \(a|b\).
  The multi-qubit version follows naturally.
  \end{defterm}

  Each stabilizer code can be represented by a \((n-k) \times 2n\) \textit{check matrix} (a.k.a. \textit{stabilizer generator matrix}) \(H=(A|B)\), where each row \((a|b)\) is the \hyperref[topic:binary-symplectic-representation]{symplectic representation} of an element from a set of generating elements of the stabilizer group.
  The check matrix can be brought into standard form (a.k.a. canonical form) via Gaussian elimination \cite{doi:10.1017/CBO9780511976667,arxiv:2408.15202}.

  A pair of \(n\)-qubit stabilizers with \hyperref[topic:binary-symplectic-representation]{symplectic representation} \((a|b)\) and \((a^{\prime}|b^{\prime})\) commute iff their symplectic inner product is zero,
  \begin{align}
    a \cdot b^{\prime} + a^{\prime}\cdot b = \sum_{j=1}^{n} a_j b^{\prime}_j + a^{\prime}_i b_i = 0~.
  \end{align}
  The set of all binary symplectic vectors form a symplectic self-orthogonal binary linear code of length \(2n\).

  Another correspondence between qubit Pauli matrices and elements of the \hyperref[topic:finite-fields]{quaternary Galois field} \(GF(4)\) yields the one-to-one correspondence between qubit stabilizer codes and trace-Hermitian self-orthogonal additive quaternary codes.

  \begin{defterm}{\(GF(4)\) representation}
  \label{topic:gf4-representation}
  An \(n\)-qubit Pauli stabilizer can be represented as a length-\(n\) quaternary vector using the one-to-one correspondence between the four Pauli matrices \(\{I,X,Y,Z\}\) and the four elements \(\{0,1,\omega^2,\omega\}\) of the \hyperref[topic:finite-fields]{quaternary Galois field} \(GF(4)\).
  \end{defterm}

  The sets of \(GF(4)\)-represented vectors for all generators yield a trace-Hermitian self-orthogonal additive quaternary code.
  This classical code corresponds to the stabilizer group \(\mathsf{S}\) while its trace-Hermitian dual corresponds to the normalizer \(\mathsf{N(S)}\).

  Alternative representations include the \textit{decoupling representation}, in which Pauli strings are represented as vectors over \(GF(2)\) using three bits \cite{arxiv:2305.17505}.

  Qubit stabilizer states can be expressed in terms of linear and quadratic functions over \(\mathbb{Z}_2^n\) \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/0304125}.

# More technically, let \(\phi\) be a bijection from a linear binary subspace to \(GF(4)^n\). Let \(C\) be a trace-Hermitian self-orthogonal additive subcode over \(GF(4)\), containing \(2^{n-k}\) vectors, such that there are no vectors of weight less than \(d\) in \(C^{\perp}\setminus C\). Then, any eigenspace of the inverse map \(\phi^{-1}(C)\) is an \([[n, k, d]]\) stabilizer code over \(GF(4)\).


protection: |
  Detects errors on up to \(d-1\) qubits, and corrects erasure errors on up to \(d-1\) qubits.
  There are algorithms to calculate the minimum distance \cite{arxiv:2109.11996,arxiv:2408.10743}.

  There is the following analogue of the \term{Knill-Laflamme conditions} for qubit stabilizer codes.
  Define the normalizer \(\mathsf{N(S)}\) of \(\mathsf{S}\) to be the set of all Pauli operators that commute with all \(S\in\mathsf{S}\).
  A stabilizer code can correct a Pauli error set \({\mathcal{E}}\) if and only if \(E^\dagger F \notin \mathsf{N(S)}\setminus \mathsf{S}\) for all \(E,F \in {\mathcal{E}}\).

  \begin{defterm}{Cleaning lemma}
  \label{topic:cleaning-lemma}
  If all logical operators act trivially on some subset of qubits in a stabilizer code, then any logical Pauli operator can be represented on the complementary qubit subset via a stabilizer.
  More technically, given any subset \(M\) of qubits that is correctable (under erasure), any logical Pauli operator \(P\) can be \textit{cleaned off} of \(M\) using a stabilizer \(S\) such that \(PS\) is supported on \(M^{\perp}\).
  More generally, for any \(M\), we have \(g(M)+g(M^{\perp}) = 2k\), where \(g(M)\) is the number of logical-\(X\) and logical-\(Z\) Pauli operators supported fully on \(M\) (up to stabilizers).
  The Cleaning Lemma was originally proven \cite{arxiv:0810.1983}, where an analogous result is states for subsystem codes; see also Ref. \cite{arxiv:2204.04699}.
  \end{defterm}

  Entropic conditions have been formulated for random projective measurement noise \cite{arxiv:2402.00145}.


# A stabilizer code is \textit{geometrically local} if the support of the stabilizer generators is bounded by a ball of size independent of \(n\).

      \label{topic:destabilizers}
      A Clifford encoding circuit maps the first \(r = n-k\) qubits to the logical qubits of the code, and the Pauli \(Z\) operators of those first \(r\) qubits are mapped into a set of stabilizer generators. 
      The set of Pauli \(X\) operators of the first \(r\) qubits that are mapped into a set of generators for the destabilizer group \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/0406196,manual:{Yoder, Theodore J. "A generalization of the stabilizer formalism for simulating arbitrary quantum circuits." See http://www. scottaaronson. com/showcase2/report/ted-yoder. pdf (2012).}}.
      Each such generator anticommutes with only one stabilizer generator while commuting with the rest of the stabilizer generators.

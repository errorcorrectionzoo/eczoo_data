name: 'Qubit stabilizer code'

description: |
  Also called a \textit{Pauli stabilizer code}. An \(((n,2^k,d))\) qubit stabilizer code is denoted as \([[n,k]]\) or \([[n,k,d]]\), where \(d\) is the code's distance. Logical subspace is the joint eigenspace of commuting Pauli operators forming the code's stabilizer group \(\mathsf{S}\). Traditionally, the logical subspace is the joint \(+1\) eigenspace of a set of \(2^{n-k}\) commuting Pauli operators which do not contain \(-I\). The distance is the minimum weight of a Pauli string that implements a nontrivial logical operation in the code.

  \begin{defterm}{Binary symplectic representation}
  \label{topic:binary-symplectic-representation}
  In the binary symplectic representation, the single-qubit identity, \(X\), \(Y\), or \(Z\) Pauli matrices represented using two bits as \((0|0)\), \((1|0)\), \((1|1)\), and \((0|1)\), respectively.
  In other words, the single-qubit Pauli string \(X^a Z^b\) is converted to the vector \(a|b\).
  The multi-qubit version follows naturally.
  \end{defterm}

  Each stabilizer code can be represented by a \((n-k) \times 2n\) \textit{check matrix} (a.k.a. \textit{stabilizer generator matrix}) \(H=(A|B)\), where each row \((a|b)\) is the binary symplectic representation of an element from a set of generating elements of the stabilizer group.
  The check matrix can be brought into standard form via Gaussian elimination \cite{doi:10.1017/CBO9780511976667}.

  A pair of \(n\)-qubit stabilizers with symplectic representations \((a|b)\) and \((a^{\prime}|b^{\prime})\) commute iff their symplectic inner product is zero,
  \begin{align}
    a \cdot b^{\prime} + a^{\prime}\cdot b = \sum_{j=1}^{n} a_j b^{\prime}_j + a^{\prime}_i b_i = 0~.
  \end{align}
  The set of all binary symplectic vectors form a symplectic self-orthogonal binary linear code of length \(2n\).

  Another correspondence between qubit Pauli matrices and elements of the Galois field \(GF(4)\) yields the one-to-one correspondence between qubit stabilizer codes and trace-Hermitian self-orthogonal additive quaternary codes.

  \begin{defterm}{\(GF(4)\) representation}
  \label{topic:gf4-representation}
  An \(n\)-qubit Pauli stabilizer can be represented as a length-\(n\) quaternary vector using the one-to-one correspondence between the four Pauli matrices \(\{I,X,Y,Z\}\) and the four elements \(\{0,1,\alpha^2,\alpha\}\) of the quaternary field \(GF(4)\).
  \end{defterm}

  The sets of \(GF(4)\)-represented vectors for all generators yield a trace-Hermitian self-orthogonal additive quaternary code.
  This classical code corresponds to the stabilizer group \(\mathsf{S}\) while its trace-Hermitian dual corresponds to the normalizer \(\mathsf{N(S)}\).

  Alternative representations include the \textit{decoupling representation}, in which Pauli strings are represented as vectors over \(GF(2)\) using three bits \cite{arxiv:2305.17505}.

  Qubit stabilizer states can be expressed in terms of linear and quadratic functions over \(\mathbb{Z}_2^n\) \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/0304125}.
  Qubit stabilizer codes can equivalently \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/0111080} (see also \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/0703112}) be defined using graphs, yielding an analytical form for the codewords \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/0012111}.
  Clifford operations can be realized as operations acting on the corresponding graphs \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/0308151}.

# More technically, let \(\phi\) be a bijection from a linear binary subspace to \(GF(4)^n\). Let \(C\) be a trace-Hermitian self-orthogonal additive subcode over \(GF(4)\), containing \(2^{n-k}\) vectors, such that there are no vectors of weight less than \(d\) in \(C^{\perp}\setminus C\). Then, any eigenspace of the inverse map \(\phi^{-1}(C)\) is an \([[n, k, d]]\) stabilizer code over \(GF(4)\).


protection: |
  Detects errors on up to \(d-1\) qubits, and corrects erasure errors on up to \(d-1\) qubits.

  There is the following analogue of the \term{Knill-Laflamme conditions} for qubit stabilizer codes.
  Define the normalizer \(\mathsf{N(S)}\) of \(\mathsf{S}\) to be the set of all Pauli operators that commute with all \(S\in\mathsf{S}\).
  A stabilizer code can correct a Pauli error set \({\mathcal{E}}\) if and only if \(E^\dagger F \notin \mathsf{N(S)}\setminus \mathsf{S}\) for all \(E,F \in {\mathcal{E}}\).

  \begin{defterm}{Cleaning lemma}
  \label{topic:cleaning-lemma}
  If all logical operators act trivially on some subset of qubits in a stabilizer code, then any logical Pauli operator can be represented on the complementary qubit subset via a stabilizer.
  More technically, given any subset \(M\) of qubits that is correctable (under erasure), any logical Pauli operator \(P\) can be \textit{cleaned off} of \(M\) using a stabilizer \(S\) such that \(PS\) is supported on \(M^{\perp}\).
  More generally, for any \(M\), we have \(g(M)+g(M^{\perp}) = 2k\), where \(g(M)\) is the number of logical-\(X\) and logical-\(Z\) Pauli operators supported fully on \(M\) (up to stabilizers).
  The Cleaning Lemma was originally proven \cite{arxiv:0810.1983}, where an analogous result is states for subsystem codes; see also Ref. \cite{arxiv:2204.04699}.
  \end{defterm}

  Entropic conditions have been formulated for random projective measurement noise \cite{arxiv:2402.00145}.


# A stabilizer code is \textit{geometrically local} if the support of the stabilizer generators is bounded by a ball of size independent of \(n\).

  encoders:
    - 'Clifford circuits, i.e., those consisting of CNOT, Hadamard, and certain phase gates, using an algorithm \cite{arxiv:2301.02356} based on the Gottesman-Knill theorem \cite{arXiv:quant-ph/0406196} or using ZX calculus \cite{doi:10.1007/978-3-540-70583-3_25,arxiv:0906.4725}.'
    - 'Circuits obtained by first constructing the CWS form of the code \cite{arXiv:0803.3232,arXiv:0708.1021}. These consist of \(n\) Hadamard gates, a classical encoder which takes at most \(n\) CX gates for a single-qubit encoding code, and at most \(n(n-1)/2\) CZ gates to create the needed graph state.'
    - 'Lindbladian-based dissipative encoding \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/9707049,arXiv:1310.1036}, for which codespace is steady-state space of a Lindbladian. This does not give a speedup, in terms of scaling with \(n\), over circuit-based encoders \cite{arxiv:1310.1037}.'

  transversal_gates: 'All stabilizer codes realize Pauli transformations transversally; for a single logical qubit, these a realize dicyclic subgroup of \(SU(2)\).
  Several algorithms exist for finding logical Pauli operators \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/9705052,arxiv:0903.5256,arxiv:1803.06987}.
  The four-block transversal gate mapping each \(X \to IXXX\) and each \(Z \to IZZZ\) implements the same logical gate on all qubits \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/9705052}.
  More generally, transversal logical gates are in a finite level of the \term{Clifford hierarchy}, which is shown using stabilizer \textit{disjointness} \cite{arxiv:1710.07256} (see also \cite{arxiv:0706.1382,arxiv:1409.8320}).
  Transversal gates for \(n\in\{1,2\}\) are semi-Clifford \cite{arxiv:0712.2084}.
  No stabilizer code can implement a classical universal gate set transversally \cite{arxiv:1704.07798}.'

If the noise model is such that the most likely error is the lowest-weight error, then ML decoding is called \textit{minimum-weight} decoding.

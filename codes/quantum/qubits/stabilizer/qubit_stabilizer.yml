name: 'Qubit stabilizer code'
introduced: '\cite{arXiv:quant-ph/9605005,arXiv:quant-ph/9705052}'

description: |
  Also called a \textit{Pauli stabilizer code}. An \(((n,2^k,d))\) qubit stabilizer code is denoted as \([[n,k]]\) or \([[n,k,d]]\), where \(d\) is the code's distance. Logical subspace is the joint eigenspace of commuting Pauli operators forming the code's stabilizer group \(\mathsf{S}\). Traditionally, the logical subspace is the joint \(+1\) eigenspace of a set of \(2^{n-k}\) commuting Pauli operators which do not contain \(-I\). The distance is the minimum weight of a Pauli string that implements a nontrivial logical operation in the code.

  \begin{defterm}{Binary symplectic representation}
  \label{topic:binary-symplectic-representation}
  Each stabilizer code can be represented by a \((n-k) \times 2n\) \textit{check matrix} (a.k.a. \textit{stabilizer generator matrix}) \(H=(A|B)\), where each row \((a|b)\) is the binary symplectic representation of an element from a set of generating elements of the stabilizer group.
  In the symplectic representation, the single-qubit identity, \(X\), \(Y\), or \(Z\) Pauli matrices represented using two bits as \((0|0)\), \((1|0)\), \((1|1)\), and \((0|1)\), respectively.
  The check matrix can be brought into standard form via Gaussian elimination \cite{doi:10.1017/CBO9780511976667}.
  \end{defterm}

  The stabilizer commutation condition can equivalently be stated in the symplectic representation. A pair of \(n\)-qubit stabilizers with symplectic representations \((a|b)\) and \((a^{\prime}|b^{\prime})\) commute iff their symplectic inner product is zero,
  \begin{align}
    a \cdot b^{\prime} + a^{\prime}\cdot b = \sum_{j=1}^{n} a_j b^{\prime}_j + a^{\prime}_i b_i = 0~.
  \end{align}
  Binary symplectic representations of stabilizer group elements thus form a self-orthogonal subspace of \(GF(2)^{2n}\) with respect to the symplectic inner product.

  Alternative representations include the \textit{decoupling representation}, in which Pauli strings are represented as vectors over \(GF(2)\) using three bits \cite{arxiv:2305.17505}, or the representation over \(GF(4)\) (see stabilizer codes over \(GF(4)\)).


protection: |
  Detects errors on up to \(d-1\) qubits, and corrects erasure errors on up to \(d-1\) qubits. More generally, define the normalizer \(\mathsf{N(S)}\) of \(\mathsf{S}\) to be the set of all Pauli operators that commute with all \(S\in\mathsf{S}\). A stabilizer code can correct a Pauli error set \({\mathcal{E}}\) if and only if \(E^\dagger F \notin \mathsf{N(S)}\setminus \mathsf{S}\) for all \(E,F \in {\mathcal{E}}\).

  A stabilizer code is \textit{geometrically local} if the support of the stabilizer generators is bounded by a ball of size independent of \(n\).

features:
  encoders:
    - 'Clifford circuits, i.e., those consisting of CNOT, Hadamard, and certain phase gates, using an algorithm based on the Gottesman-Knill theorem \cite{arXiv:quant-ph/0406196} or using ZX calculus \cite{doi:10.1007/978-3-540-70583-3_25,arxiv:0906.4725} \cite{arxiv:2301.02356}.'
    - 'Circuits obtained by first constructing the CWS form of the code \cite{arXiv:0803.3232,arXiv:0708.1021}. These consist of \(n\) Hadamard gates, a classical encoder which takes at most \(n\) CX gates for a single-qubit encoding code, and at most \(n(n-1)/2\) CZ gates to create the needed graph state.'
    - 'Lindbladian-based dissipative encoding \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/9707049,arXiv:1310.1036}, for which codespace is steady-state space of a Lindbladian. This does not give a speedup, in terms of scaling with \(n\), over circuit-based encoders \cite{arxiv:1310.1037}.'

  transversal_gates: 'All stabilizer codes realize Pauli transformations transversally; for a single logical qubit, these a realize dicyclic subgroup of \(SU(2)\). More generally, transversal logical gates are in a finite level of the Clifford hierarchy, which is shown using stabilizer \textit{disjointness} \cite{arxiv:1710.07256} (see also \cite{arxiv:0706.1382,arxiv:1409.8320}). Transversal gates for \(n\in\{1,2\}\) are semi-Clifford \cite{arxiv:0712.2084}.'

  general_gates:
    - 'With pieceable fault-tolerance, any nondegenerate stabilizer code with a complete set of fault-tolerant single-qubit Clifford gates has a universal set of non-transversal fault-tolerant gates \cite{arXiv:1603.03948}.'
  decoders:
    - 'The structure of stabilizer codes allows for \textit{syndrome-based decoding}, where errors are corrected based on the results of stabilizer measurements (\textit{syndromes}). The size of the circuit extracting the syndrome depends on the weight of its corresponding stabilizer generator. \textit{Maximum-likelihood} (ML) decoding, i.e., the process of finding the most likely error, is \(NP\)-complete in general \cite{arxiv:1009.1319,manual:{Kuo, Kao-Yueh, and Chung-Chin Lu. "On the hardness of decoding quantum stabilizer codes under the depolarizing channel." 2012 International Symposium on Information Theory and its Applications. IEEE, 2012.}}. If the noise model is such that the most likely error is the lowest-weight error, then ML decoding is called \textit{minimum-weight} decoding. \textit{Degenerate maximum-likelihood} decoding, i.e., the process of finding the most likely error class (up to degeneracy of errors), is \(\#P\)-complete in general \cite{arxiv:1310.3235}.'

  fault_tolerance:
    - 'Logical Bell measurements can be done transversally, and thus fault tolerantly, by performing bitwise Bell measurements for each pair of qubits (with each member of the pair taken from one of the two code blocks) and processing the result.'
    - 'With pieceable fault-tolerance, any nondegenerate stabilizer code with a complete set of fault-tolerant single-qubit Clifford gates has a universal set of non-transversal fault-tolerant gates \cite{arXiv:1603.03948}.'

  code_capacity_threshold:
    - 'Bounds on code capacity thresholds using maximum-likelihood (ML) decoding can be obtained by mapping the effect of noise on the code to a statistical mechanical model \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/0110143,arXiv:1208.2317,arXiv:1311.7688,arXiv:1809.10704}.'

  threshold:
    - 'Computational thresholds against stochastic local noise can be achieved through repeated use of concatenatenation, and can rely on the same small code in every level \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/9702058,arxiv:quant-ph/9906129,arXiv:quant-ph/9705031,arXiv:quant-ph/0504218}. The resulting code is highly degenerate, with all but an exponentially small fraction of generators having small weights. Circuit and measurement designs have to take case of the few stabilizer generators with large weights in order to be fault tolerant.'

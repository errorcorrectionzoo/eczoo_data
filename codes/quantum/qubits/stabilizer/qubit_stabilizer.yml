description: |
  An \(((n,2^k,d))\) qubit stabilizer code is denoted as \([[n,k]]\) or \([[n,k,d]]\), where \(d\) is the code's distance.
  Logical subspace is the joint eigenspace of commuting Pauli operators forming the code's stabilizer group \(\mathsf{S}\).
  Traditionally, the logical subspace is the joint \(+1\) eigenspace of a set of \(2^{n-k}\) commuting Pauli operators which do not contain \(-I\).
  The distance is the minimum weight of a Pauli string that implements a nontrivial logical operation in the code.

  Qubit stabilizer codes form the joint \(+1\)-eigenspace of a stabilizer group \(\mathsf{S}\), i.e., a group of commuting Paulis that does not contain the identity and is generated by \(r=n-k\) generators.
  The table below summarizes the relevant groups and their sizes for a qubit stabilizer code.
    \begin{table}
      \begin{cells}
      \celldata<c H, c H, c H>{purpose & symbol & size}
      \celldata<c, c, c>{
      stabilizer group & \(\mathsf{S}\) & \(2^{n-k}\)
          \\
      code-preserving Paulis & \(\mathsf{N}(\mathsf{S})\) & \(4\cdot 2^{n+k}\)
          \\
      logical Paulis & \(\mathsf{N}(\mathsf{S})/\mathsf{S}\) & \(4^{k}\)
      }
      \end{cells}
      \caption{Groups relevant to qubit stabilizer codes. The normalizer \(\mathsf{N}(\mathsf{S})\) (technically, the centralizer, but these are equivalent for this case) is the group formed by all elements of the \(n\)-qubit Pauli group that commute with all elements in \(\mathsf{S}\). The normalizer is defined so as to include \(i\) and its powers as elements, while the stabilizer group is not.}
      \label{table:stabilizer-groups}
    \end{table}

  Two qubit stabilizer codes codes are \textit{equivalent} if the codespace of one code can be mapped into that of the other under a tensor product of elements of the \hyperref[topic:clifford]{single-qubit Clifford group} and a qubit permutation.
  Equivalence under single-qubit Clifford operations is not the same as the equivalence under a tensor product of arbitrary single-qubit unitary operations \cite{arxiv:0709.1266}.
  A qubit stabiilzer code is \textit{decomposable} if there exists a permutation that maps the stabilizer group into a tensor product of two stabilizer groups acting on disjoint sets of qubits.

  \subsection{Code representations}

  Instead of being represented by a basis of codewords, stabilizer codes can be concisely defined and represented by a presentation of the generators of the stabilizer group.  
  Stabilizer generators can be arranged as rows of a matrix, forming a \textit{stabilizer tableau}. 
  A set of generators is not unique, and various stabilizer codes admit generators with certain locality properties.

  For example, a stabilizer tableau of a two-qubit Bell-state stabilizer state is \(\left[\begin{smallmatrix}Z & Z\\ X & X \end{smallmatrix}\right]\).
  Another tableau can be defined by letting \(X \to Y\). 

  Pauli strings, and the corresponding stabilizer tableaus, can be represented in other ways.

  \begin{defterm}{Symplectic representation}
  \label{topic:binary-symplectic-representation}
  In the symplectic representation, the single-qubit identity, \(X\), \(Y\), or \(Z\) Pauli matrices represented using two bits as \((0|0)\), \((1|0)\), \((1|1)\), and \((0|1)\), respectively.
  In other words, the single-qubit Pauli string \(X^a Z^b\) is converted to the vector \(a|b\).
  The multi-qubit version follows naturally.
  \end{defterm}

  Each stabilizer code can be represented by a \((n-k) \times 2n\) \textit{check matrix} (a.k.a. \textit{stabilizer generator matrix}) \(H=(A|B)\), where each row \((a|b)\) is the \hyperref[topic:binary-symplectic-representation]{symplectic representation} of an element from a set of generating elements of the stabilizer group.
  The check matrix can be brought into standard form (a.k.a. canonical form) via Gaussian elimination \cite{doi:10.1017/CBO9780511976667,arxiv:2408.15202}.

  A pair of \(n\)-qubit stabilizers with \hyperref[topic:binary-symplectic-representation]{symplectic representation} \((a|b)\) and \((a^{\prime}|b^{\prime})\) commute iff their symplectic inner product is zero,
  \begin{align}
    a \cdot b^{\prime} + a^{\prime}\cdot b = \sum_{j=1}^{n} a_j b^{\prime}_j + a^{\prime}_i b_i = 0~.
  \end{align}
  The set of all binary symplectic vectors form a symplectic self-orthogonal binary linear code of length \(2n\).

  Another correspondence between qubit Pauli matrices and elements of the \hyperref[topic:finite-fields]{quaternary Galois field} \(GF(4)\) yields the one-to-one correspondence between qubit stabilizer codes and trace-Hermitian self-orthogonal additive quaternary codes.

  \begin{defterm}{\(GF(4)\) representation}
  \label{topic:gf4-representation}
  An \(n\)-qubit Pauli stabilizer can be represented as a length-\(n\) quaternary vector using the one-to-one correspondence between the four Pauli matrices \(\{I,X,Y,Z\}\) and the four elements \(\{0,1,\omega^2,\omega\}\) of the \hyperref[topic:finite-fields]{quaternary Galois field} \(GF(4)\).
  \end{defterm}

  The sets of \(GF(4)\)-represented vectors for all generators yield a trace-Hermitian self-orthogonal additive quaternary code.
  This classical code corresponds to the stabilizer group \(\mathsf{S}\) while its trace-Hermitian dual corresponds to the normalizer \(\mathsf{N(S)}\).
  In the case of stabilizer states, the correspondence is between such states and trace-Hermitian self-dual quaternary codes; such codes, and therefore such states, have been classified up to equivalence for \(n \leq 12\) \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/0503236,arxiv:math/0504522}.

  ZX calculus is complete, sound, and universal for qubit stabilizer codes \cite{arxiv:1307.7025}.
  Any stabilizer code can be represented by a \textit{ZX canonical form} (ZXCF) \cite{arxiv:2411.14448}, and there exist two other representations \cite{arxiv:2205.02009,arxiv:2411.14448} that utilize ZX calculus.
  \begin{defterm}{Encoder-respecting form}
  \label{topic:encoder-respecting}
  In an \textit{encoder-respecting form}, each qubit stabilizer code \cite{arxiv:2411.14448} (see also Ref. \cite{arxiv:2109.10210}) is represented by a semi-bipartite graph with \(k\) input and \(n\) output nodes in which the \(k\) input nodes are not connected to each other.
  Conversion between stabilizer tableaus and graphs is achieved using ZX calculus and takes time that is polynomial in \(n\). 
  Properties of the underlying graph are related to properties of the code \cite{arxiv:2411.14448}.
  \end{defterm}

  Alternative representations include the \textit{decoupling representation}, in which Pauli strings are represented as vectors over \(GF(2)\) using three bits \cite{arxiv:2305.17505}.
  Qubit stabilizer states can be expressed in terms of linear and quadratic functions over \(\mathbb{Z}_2^n\) \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/0304125}.

# More technically, let \(\phi\) be a bijection from a linear binary subspace to \(GF(4)^n\). Let \(C\) be a trace-Hermitian self-orthogonal additive subcode over \(GF(4)\), containing \(2^{n-k}\) vectors, such that there are no vectors of weight less than \(d\) in \(C^{\perp}\setminus C\). Then, any eigenspace of the inverse map \(\phi^{-1}(C)\) is an \([[n, k, d]]\) stabilizer code over \(GF(4)\).


protection: |
  Detects errors on up to \(d-1\) qubits, and corrects erasure errors on up to \(d-1\) qubits.
  There are algorithms to calculate the minimum distance \cite{arxiv:2109.11996,arxiv:2408.10743,arxiv:2409.13017}.
  Computing the distance exactly or approximately is generally \(NP\)-complete, and is \(NP\)-hard for \hyperref[topic:degeneracy]{non-degenerate} codes \cite{arxiv:2203.04262}.
  Distance approximation and stabilizer \hyperref[topic:weight-reduction]{weight reduction} are approximately optimal strategies for various quantum lights-out (QLO) games that can be played on the codes'' \hyperref[topic:encoder-respecting]{encoder-respecting form} \cite{arxiv:2411.14448}.

  There is the following analogue of the \term{Knill-Laflamme conditions} for qubit stabilizer codes.
  Define the normalizer \(\mathsf{N(S)}\) of \(\mathsf{S}\) to be the set of all Pauli operators that commute with all \(S\in\mathsf{S}\).
  A stabilizer code can correct a Pauli error set \({\mathcal{E}}\) if and only if \(E^\dagger F \notin \mathsf{N(S)}\setminus \mathsf{S}\) for all \(E,F \in {\mathcal{E}}\).

  \begin{defterm}{Cleaning lemma}
  \label{topic:cleaning-lemma}
  If all logical operators act trivially on some subset of qubits in a stabilizer code, then any logical Pauli operator can be represented on the complementary qubit subset via a stabilizer.
  More technically, given any subset \(M\) of qubits that is correctable (under erasure), any logical Pauli operator \(P\) can be \textit{cleaned off} of \(M\) using a stabilizer \(S\) such that \(PS\) is supported on \(M^{\perp}\).
  More generally, for any \(M\), we have \(g(M)+g(M^{\perp}) = 2k\), where \(g(M)\) is the number of logical-\(X\) and logical-\(Z\) Pauli operators supported fully on \(M\) (up to stabilizers).
  The Cleaning Lemma was originally proven \cite{arxiv:0810.1983}, where an analogous result is states for subsystem codes; see also Ref. \cite{arxiv:2204.04699}.
  \end{defterm}

  Entropic conditions have been formulated for random projective measurement noise \cite{arxiv:2402.00145}.

  The \hyperref[topic:quantum-gv-bound]{quantum GV bound} can be extended into a three-way tradeoff between distance, rate, and stabilizer weight of a qubit stabilizer code \cite{arxiv:2411.14448}.  


# A stabilizer code is \textit{geometrically local} if the support of the stabilizer generators is bounded by a ball of size independent of \(n\).

      \label{topic:destabilizers}

      For example, \([[4,2,2]]\) qubit code generators can be adjusted to \(ZZZZ\) and \(XX^{-1} XX^{-1}\).
      A systematic procedure extending a qubit code to prime-qudit codes involves putting its generator matrix into local-dimension-invariant (LDI) form  \cite{arxiv:1910.08122}.
      Various bounds exist on the distance of the resulting codes \cite{arxiv:2110.11510,arxiv:2110.15274}.'

      detail: 'CWS codes whose underlying classical code is a linear binary code are qubit stabilizer codes containing a cluster-state codeword \cite{arxiv:0708.1021,arxiv:1407.2777}.
      Since any stabilizer state is equivalent to a cluster state under a single-qubit Clifford circuit \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/0308151}\cite[Appx. A]{arxiv:1910.00471}, any stabilizer code is similarly equivalent to a CWS code.'

        Qubit stabilizer codes are the closest quantum analogues of binary linear codes because addition modulo two corresponds to multiplication of stabilizers in the quantum case. 
        Any binary linear code can be thought of as a qubit stabilizer code with \(Z\)-type stabilizer generators \cite[Table I]{arxiv:quant-ph/0610088}. 
        The stabilizer generators are extracted from rows of the parity-check matrix, while logical \(X\) Paulis correspond to rows of the generator matrix.
        States close to the equal superposition of all bitstrings within Hamming distance \(b\) of a binary linear code can be prepared efficiently \cite{arxiv:2404.16129}.
        Binary linear codes can be used for error-corrected entanglement distillation protocols \cite{arxiv:2408.06299}.

description: |
  Holographic code constructed out of a network of hexagonal \hyperref[topic:ame]{perfect tensors} that tesselates hyperbolic space.
  The code serves as a minimal model for several aspects of the AdS/CFT holographic duality \cite{arxiv:1706.08823} and potentially a dF/CFT duality \cite{arxiv:2201.11658}.
  It has been generalized to higher dimensions \cite{arxiv:2112.12468} and to include gauge-like degrees of freedom on the links of the tensor network \cite{arxiv:1611.05841,arxiv:2108.11402}.
  All boundary global symmetries must be dual to bulk gauge symmetries, and vice versa \cite{arxiv:1810.05338}.

  The construction below is described for qubits, but straightforward generalizations exist to modular qudits, oscillators, and rotors \cite{arxiv:1902.07714}.
  Encoding is accomplished using a tensor network of five-qubit encoding isometries, which are six-legged \hyperref[topic:ame]{perfect tensors} (with five legs corresponding to the physical qubits and one for the encoded logical qubit).

  To construct the encoding, one first uniformly tiles the hyperbolic AdS/CFT disc using pentagons and hexagons.
  Then, one places a 6-legged five-qubit encoding tensor at each hexagon and pentagon, contracting legs between neighboring shapes and leaving one leg uncontracted at each pentagon.
  This construction forms an encoding isometry from the uncontracted legs in the bulk to the uncontracted legs at the boundary.

  The \textit{single-qubit HaPPY code} has a central pentagon encoding one bulk operator and hexagons tiling all other layers.
  The \textit{pentagon-hexagon HaPPY code} has alternating layers of pentagons and hexagons in the tiling.
  The \textit{pentagon HaPPY code} (a.k.a. the hyperbolic pentagon code, or HyPeC) consists of a purely pentagonal tiling.

#The bulk legs correspond to indices for logical input, while the boundary legs can be interpreted as the physical encoding.
#In the Heisenberg picture, the code can be thought of as encoding operators in the bulk of Anti de Sitter (AdS) space (formed by logical qudits) into operators on the boundary of the corresponding Conformal Field Theory (CFT, formed by the physical qudits).
#., with four pentagons/hexagons adjacent at each vertex (variants of the code can be created by choosing either a hexagon or pentagon at each location).

protection: 'Protects against erasure errors and Pauli errors on the boundary qubits.'

features:
  rate: 'The pentagon HaPPY code has an asymptotic rate \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \approx 0.447\).
  The pentagon-hexagon HaPPY code has a rate of \(0.299\) if the last layer is a pentagon layer and a rate of \(0.088\) if the last layer is a hexagon layer.'

  encoders:
    - 'Heisenberg-picture encoding is done through \textit{tensor pushing}. Each bulk operator (logical) is pushed to an operator supported on a portion of the boundary region (physical). Pushing all the bulk operators through results in reconstruction of the boundary.'

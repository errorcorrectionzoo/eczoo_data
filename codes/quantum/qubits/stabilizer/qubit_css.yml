description: |
  An \([[n,k,d]]\) stabilizer code admitting a set of stabilizer generators that are either \(Z\)-type or \(X\)-type Pauli strings.
  Codes can be defined from two classical codes and/or chain complexes over \(\mathbb{Z}_2\) per the \hyperref[topic:CSS-to-homology-correspondence]{qubit CSS-to-homology correspondence} below.
  \textit{Strong CSS codes} are codes for which there exists a set of \(X\) and \(Z\) stabilizer generators of equal weight.

  The stabilizer generator matrix is of the form
  \begin{align}
  H=\begin{pmatrix}0 & H_{Z}\\
  H_{X} & 0
  \end{pmatrix}
  \label{eq:parity}
  \end{align}
  such that the rows of the two blocks must be orthogonal
  \begin{align}
  H_X H_Z^T=0~.
  \label{eq:comm}
  \end{align}
  The above condition guarantees that the \(X\)-stabilizer generators, defined in the \hyperref[topic:binary-symplectic-representation]{symplectic representation} as rows of \(H_X\), commute with the \(Z\)-stabilizer generators associated with \(H_Z\).

  Encoding is based on two related \hyperref[code:binary_linear]{binary linear codes}, an \([n,k_X,d_X]\) code \(C_X\) and \([n,k_Z,d_Z]\) code \(C_Z\), satisfying \(C_X^\perp \subseteq C_Z\).
  The resulting CSS code has \(k=k_X+k_Z-n\) logical qubits and distance \(d\geq\min\{d_X,d_Z\}\).
  The \(H_X\) (\(H_Z\)) block of \(H\) \eqref{eq:parity} is the parity-check matrix of the code \(C_Z\) (\(C_X\)).
  The requirement \(C_X^\perp \subseteq C_Z\) guarantees \eqref{eq:comm} and also implies  \(C_Z^\perp \subseteq C_X \).
  Basis states for the code are, for \(\gamma \in C_X\),
  \begin{align}
  |\gamma + C_Z^\perp \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{|C_Z^\perp|}} \sum_{\eta \in C_Z^\perp} |\gamma + \eta\rangle.
  \end{align}

  Specializing to the case when \(C_Z=[n,k,d]\) is dual-containing yields an \([[n,2k-n,\geq d_Z]]\) \textit{self-dual qubit CSS code} (a.k.a. weakly self-dual qubit CSS code) with \(C_X = C_Z^\perp\) and with \(n\) necessarily odd.
  Its \(X\)-type and \(Z\)-type stabilizers are identically supported.

  A CSS code has \textit{stabilizer weight} \(w\) if the highest weight of any stabilizer generator is \(w\), i.e., any row of \(H_X\) and \(H_Z\) has weight at most \(w\).
  In the context of comparing weight as well as of determining distances for noise models biased toward \(X\)- or \(Z\)-type errors, an extended notation for asymmetric qubit CSS codes is \([[n,k,(d_X,d_Z),w]]\) or \([[n,k,d_X/d_Z,w]]\).
  The quantity \(\min\{d_X,d_Z\}\) is often called the \textit{worst-case minimum distance} and is often less than the actual code distance due to \hyperref[topic:degeneracy]{degeneracy} \cite{preset:GottesmanBook}.

  To find the minimum distance of \hyperref[topic:degeneracy]{degenerate} CSS code, we have to first remove the codewords of the smaller codes as those codewords correspond to stabilizer generators instead of logical operators.
  Thus the general formulae for the minimum distances \(d, d_Z, d_X\) for an \([[n,k,d]]\) or \([[n,k,(d_X,d_Z)]]\) \(CSS(C_X, C_Z)\) code are:
  \begin{align}
  d_{X}&=\min\{ w_H(c) | c \in C_X \setminus C_Z^\perp \} \\
  d_{Z}&=\min\{ w_H(c) | c \in C_Z \setminus C_X^\perp \} \\
  d&=\min\{d_X,d_Z\}~,
  \end{align}
  where \(w_H\) is the Hamming weight of a codeword.

  \subsection{CSS-to-homology correspondence}

  \begin{defterm}{Qubit CSS-to-homology correspondence}
  \label{topic:CSS-to-homology-correspondence}
  CSS codes and their properties can be formulated in terms of homology theory, yielding a powerful correspondence between codes and chain complexes, the primary homological structures.
  There exists a many-to-one mapping from size three chain complexes to CSS codes \cite{doi:10.1070/RM1997v052n06ABEH002155,arxiv:quant-ph/0605094,arxiv:1311.0885,arxiv:1802.01520} that allows one to extract code properties from topological features of the complexes.
  Codes constructed in this manner are sometimes called \textit{homological CSS codes}, but they are equivalent to CSS codes.
  This mapping of codes to manifolds allows the application of structures from topology to error correction, yielding \hyperref[code:generalized_homological_product]{various QLDPC codes} with favorable properties.
  \end{defterm}

  A \textit{chain complex} of size three is given by binary vector spaces \(A_2\), \(A_1\), \(A_0\) and binary matrices \(\partial_{i=1,2}\) (called \textit{boundary operators}) \(A_i\) to \(A_{i-1}\) that satisfy \(\partial_1 \partial_2 = 0\). Such a complex is typically denoted as
  \begin{align}
  A_2 \xrightarrow{\partial_2} A_1 \xrightarrow{\partial_1} A_0~.
  \label{eq:chain}
  \end{align}
  One constructs a CSS code by associating a physical qubit to every basis element of \(A_1\), and defining parity-check matrices \(H_X=\partial_1\) and \(H_Z=\partial_2^T\)). That way, the spaces \(A_0\) and \(A_2\) can be associated with \(X\)-type and \(Z\)-type Pauli operators, respectively, and boundary operators determine the Paulis making up the stabilizer generators. The requirement \(\partial_1 \partial_2 = 0\) guarantees that the \(X\)-stabilizer generators associated with \(H_X\) commute with the \(Z\)-stabilizer generators associated with \(H_Z\).
  See \cite[Table 3.2]{arxiv:1504.01444} for a Rosetta stone comparing statistical mechanical models, CSS codes, and chain complexes.

  Usually, the chain complex \eqref{eq:chain} used in the construction comes from the chain complex associated with a cellulation of a manifold. When the manifold is a two-dimensional surface, its entire chain is used.
  Higher-dimensional manifolds allow for longer chain complexes, and one can use the three largest non-trivial vector spaces in its chain.

  CSS codes saturate a type of \textit{error correction uncertainty relation} \cite[Thm. 3]{doi:10.1103/PhysRevLett.77.793}, which is a special case of an entropic uncertainty relation between a pair of bases \cite{doi:10.1007/BF01608825,doi:10.1103/PhysRevLett.50.631,doi:10.1103/PhysRevLett.60.1103}.
  The code state \(\sum_{c\in C_{Z}}|c\rangle\) can be expressed in terms of either basis states labeled by the code \(C_{Z}\) or its dual, satisfying, with equality, the relation
  \begin{align}
    |C_{Z}||C_{Z}^{\perp}| \geq 2^{n}\,.
  \end{align}


#  The reverse mapping is as follows \cite{arxiv:1311.0885,arxiv:1807.09783}. Given a CSS code with parity check matrices \(H_X\) and \(H_Z\), let both boundary operators be \(\partial = H_Z^TUH_X\) for an arbitrary invertible matrix \(U\). The fact that the stabilizer generators commute ensures that the boundary operator satisfies \(\partial^2=0\), yielding a chain complex.
#  Then, the normalizer of the stabilizers \({\mathsf{N}}(C_X)\) and \({\mathsf{N}}(C_Z)\) is \(\text{Ker}(\partial_2^T)\) and \(\text{Ker}(\partial_1)\), respectively.
# Insert table linking manifold properties to QEC
# condition Then, the code derived from a chain with this boundary operator yields classical codes \(C_X\) and \(C_Z\) with codewords in \(\text{Im}(\partial^T)\) and \(\text{Im}(\partial)\), respectively.

protection: |
  Detects errors on \(d-1\) qubits, corrects errors on \(\left\lfloor (d-1)/2 \right\rfloor\) qubits.

  Using the relation to chain complexes, the number of encoded logical qubits is equal to the dimension of the first \(\mathbb{Z}_2\)-homology of the chain complex, \(H_1(\partial, \mathbb{Z}_2) = \frac{\text{Ker}(\partial_1)}{\text{Im}(\partial_2)}\).

  The distance of the CSS code is equal to the minimum of the combinatorial (\(d-1\))-systole of the cellulated \(d\)-dimensional manifold and its dual.

  CSS codes have a \textit{CSS lower bound} against depolarizing noise because CSS decoding does not take into account correlations between \(X\)- and \(Z\)-type noise \cite{doi:10.1109/ISIT.2013.6620358}.
  An upper bound is formulated in Ref. \cite{arxiv:2308.07915}.

  \begin{defterm}{Steane enlargement}
  \label{topic:steane-enlargement}
  An \([[n,2k-n,d]]\) CSS code can be converted to a \([[n,k+k^{\prime}âˆ’n,\min(d,\left\lceil 3d^{\prime}/2\right\rceil )]]\) code for particular \(k^{\prime}\) and \(d^{\prime}\) via the Steane enlargement construction \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/9802061}.
  \end{defterm}

  Using linear programming (LP) to solve a set of equations and inequalities on weight distribution of a classical self-orthogonal code \(C=(n, 2^n-k)\) and its dual, one can find a \(C\) such that the \([[n,k,d]]\) CSS code constructed using \(C\) and its dual would have rate and distance close to the Singleton bound \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/9608006}.

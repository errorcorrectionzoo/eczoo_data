description: |
  An \([[n,k,d]]\) stabilizer code admitting a set of stabilizer generators that are either \(Z\)-type or \(X\)-type Pauli strings.
  Codes can be defined from two classical codes and/or chain complexes over \(\mathbb{Z}_2\) per the \hyperref[topic:CSS-to-homology-correspondence]{qubit CSS-to-homology correspondence} below.

  The stabilizer generator matrix is of the form
  \begin{align}
  H=\begin{pmatrix}0 & H_{Z}\\
  H_{X} & 0
  \end{pmatrix}
  \label{eq:parity}
  \end{align}
  such that the rows of the two blocks must be orthogonal
  \begin{align}
  H_X H_Z^T=0~.
  \label{eq:comm}
  \end{align}
  The above condition guarantees that the \(X\)-stabilizer generators, defined in the \hyperref[topic:binary-symplectic-representation]{symplectic representation} as rows of \(H_X\), commute with the \(Z\)-stabilizer generators associated with \(H_Z\).
  A qubit stabilizer code is a qubit CSS code if and only if \(\text{rank}H_X + \text{rank} H_Z = n-k\) \cite[Lemma 7.4]{arxiv:2501.17447}.

  Encoding is based on two related \hyperref[code:binary_linear]{binary linear codes}, an \([n,k_X,\delta_X]\) code \(C_X\) and \([n,k_Z,\delta_Z]\) code \(C_Z\), satisfying \(C_X^\perp \subseteq C_Z\).
  The resulting CSS code has \(k=k_X+k_Z-n\) logical qubits.
  The \(H_X\) (\(H_Z\)) block of \(H\) \eqref{eq:parity} is the parity-check matrix of the code \(C_Z\) (\(C_X\)).
  The requirement \(C_X^\perp \subseteq C_Z\) guarantees \eqref{eq:comm} and also implies  \(C_Z^\perp \subseteq C_X \).
  Basis states for the code are, for coset representatives \(\gamma \in C_X/C_Z^\perp\),
  \begin{align}
  |\gamma + C_Z^\perp \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{|C_Z^\perp|}} \sum_{\eta \in C_Z^\perp} |\gamma + \eta\rangle.
  \end{align}

  Specializing to the case when \(C_Z=[n,k]\) is dual-containing yields an \([[n,2k-n]]\) \textit{self-dual qubit CSS code} (a.k.a. weakly self-dual qubit CSS code) with \(C_X = C_Z\) and with \(n\) necessarily odd.
  Its \(X\)-type and \(Z\)-type stabilizers are identically supported.

  
  \subsection{CSS-to-homology correspondence}

  \begin{defterm}{Qubit CSS-to-homology correspondence}
  \label{topic:CSS-to-homology-correspondence}
  CSS codes and their properties can be formulated in terms of homology theory, yielding a powerful correspondence between codes and chain complexes, the primary homological structures.
  There exists a many-to-one mapping from size three chain complexes to CSS codes \cite{doi:10.1070/RM1997v052n06ABEH002155,arxiv:quant-ph/0605094,arxiv:1311.0885,arxiv:1802.01520,arxiv:2505.06082} that allows one to extract code properties from topological features of the complexes.
  Codes constructed in this manner are sometimes called \textit{homological CSS codes}, but they are equivalent to CSS codes.
  This mapping of codes to manifolds allows the application of structures from topology to error correction, yielding \hyperref[code:generalized_homological_product]{various QLDPC codes} with favorable properties.
  \end{defterm}

  A \textit{chain complex} of size three is given by binary vector spaces \(A_2\), \(A_1\), \(A_0\) and binary matrices \(\partial_{i=1,2}\) (called \textit{boundary operators}) \(A_i\) to \(A_{i-1}\) that satisfy \(\partial_1 \partial_2 = 0\). Such a complex is typically denoted as
  \begin{align}
  A_2 \xrightarrow{\partial_2} A_1 \xrightarrow{\partial_1} A_0~.
  \label{eq:chain}
  \end{align}
  One constructs a CSS code by associating a physical qubit to every basis element of \(A_1\), and defining parity-check matrices \(H_X=\partial_1\) and \(H_Z=\partial_2^T\)). That way, the spaces \(A_0\) and \(A_2\) can be associated with \(X\)-type and \(Z\)-type Pauli operators, respectively, and boundary operators determine the Paulis making up the stabilizer generators. The requirement \(\partial_1 \partial_2 = 0\) guarantees that the \(X\)-stabilizer generators associated with \(H_X\) commute with the \(Z\)-stabilizer generators associated with \(H_Z\).
  The number of encoded logical qubits is equal to the dimension of the first \(\mathbb{Z}_2\)-homology of the chain complex, \(H_1(\partial, \mathbb{Z}_2) = \frac{\text{Ker}(\partial_1)}{\text{Im}(\partial_2)}\).
  See \cite[Table 3.2]{arxiv:1504.01444} for a Rosetta stone comparing statistical mechanical models, CSS codes, and chain complexes.

  Usually, the chain complex \eqref{eq:chain} used in the construction comes from the chain complex associated with a cellulation of a manifold. When the manifold is a two-dimensional surface, its entire chain is used.
  Higher-dimensional manifolds allow for longer chain complexes, and one can use the three largest non-trivial vector spaces in its chain.

  CSS codes saturate a type of \textit{error correction uncertainty relation} \cite[Thm. 3]{doi:10.1103/PhysRevLett.77.793}, which is a special case of an entropic uncertainty relation between a pair of bases \cite{doi:10.1007/BF01608825,doi:10.1103/PhysRevLett.50.631,doi:10.1103/PhysRevLett.60.1103}.
  The code state \(\sum_{c\in C_{Z}}|c\rangle\) can be expressed in terms of either basis states labeled by the code \(C_{Z}\) or its dual, satisfying, with equality, the relation
  \begin{align}
    |C_{Z}||C_{Z}^{\perp}| \geq 2^{n}\,.
  \end{align}


#  The reverse mapping is as follows \cite{arxiv:1311.0885,arxiv:1807.09783}. Given a CSS code with parity check matrices \(H_X\) and \(H_Z\), let both boundary operators be \(\partial = H_Z^TUH_X\) for an arbitrary invertible matrix \(U\). The fact that the stabilizer generators commute ensures that the boundary operator satisfies \(\partial^2=0\), yielding a chain complex.
#  Then, the normalizer of the stabilizers \({\mathsf{N}}(C_X)\) and \({\mathsf{N}}(C_Z)\) is \(\text{Ker}(\partial_2^T)\) and \(\text{Ker}(\partial_1)\), respectively.
# Insert table linking manifold properties to QEC
# condition Then, the code derived from a chain with this boundary operator yields classical codes \(C_X\) and \(C_Z\) with codewords in \(\text{Im}(\partial^T)\) and \(\text{Im}(\partial)\), respectively.

protection: |
  The quantity \(\min\{\delta_X,\delta_Z\}\) is the CSS code's \hyperref[topic:quantum-weight-enumerator]{pure distance} \cite{arxiv:2209.13474}, and it is equal to the code distance for a \hyperref[topic:degeneracy]{non-degenerate} code.
  To find the code distance of a \hyperref[topic:degeneracy]{degenerate} CSS code, we have to first remove the codewords of the smaller codes as those codewords correspond to stabilizer generators instead of logical operators.
  The general formulae are
  \begin{align}
  d_{X}&=\min\{ w_H(c) | c \in C_X \setminus C_Z^\perp \} \geq \delta_X \\
  d_{Z}&=\min\{ w_H(c) | c \in C_Z \setminus C_X^\perp \} \geq \delta_Z \\
  d&=\min\{d_X,d_Z\}~,
  \end{align}
  where \(w_H\) is the Hamming weight of a codeword.
  In the homology correspondence, the code distance is equal to the minimum of the combinatorial (\(d-1\))-systole of the cellulated \(d\)-dimensional manifold and its dual.

  A CSS code has \textit{stabilizer weight} \(w\) if the highest weight of any stabilizer generator is \(w\), i.e., any row of \(H_X\) and \(H_Z\) has weight at most \(w\).
  \textit{Strong CSS codes} are codes for which there exists a set of \(X\) and \(Z\) stabilizer generators of equal weight.
  In the context of comparing weight as well as of determining distances for noise models biased toward \(X\)- or \(Z\)-type errors, an extended notation for asymmetric qubit CSS codes is \([[n,k,(d_X,d_Z),w]]\) or \([[n,k,d_X/d_Z,w]]\).

  CSS codes have a \textit{CSS lower bound} against depolarizing noise because CSS decoding does not take into account correlations between \(X\)- and \(Z\)-type noise \cite{doi:10.1109/ISIT.2013.6620358}.
  An upper bound is formulated in Ref. \cite{arxiv:2308.07915}.

  \begin{defterm}{Steane enlargement}
  \label{topic:steane-enlargement}
  An \([[n,2k-n,d]]\) CSS code can be converted to a \([[n,k+k^{\prime}âˆ’n,\min(d,\left\lceil 3d^{\prime}/2\right\rceil )]]\) code for particular \(k^{\prime}\) and \(d^{\prime}\) via the Steane enlargement construction \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/9802061}.
  \end{defterm}

  Using linear programming (LP) to solve a set of equations and inequalities on weight distribution of a classical self-orthogonal code \(C=(n, 2^n-k)\) and its dual, one can find a \(C\) such that the \([[n,k,d]]\) CSS code constructed using \(C\) and its dual would have rate and distance close to the Singleton bound \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/9608006}.

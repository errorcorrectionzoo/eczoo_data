name: 'Quantum Error-Correction for Quantum Metrology'
introduced: '\cite{doi:10.1103/PRXQuantum.2.010343}'


description: 'Quantum metrology is the study of precisely estimating parameters that characterize the
Hamiltonian of a quantum system. 

Classically, the precision of estimation improves with the number of trials of an experiment, n, as \( \propto 1/\sqrt{n}\), which is known as the Standard Quantum Limit (SQL). The more fundamental bound set by quantum mechanics on the estimation of a single parameter is called the Heisenberg Limit (HL), where the error scales as \( n^{âˆ’1}\). Using quantum-enhanced techniques, such as entanglement with the use of cat-states, it is theoretical possible to achieve the Heisenberg Limit of precision in the absence of noise. However, in the presence of noise, the advantage in precision due to entanglement is cancelled out. Hence quantum error-correction is proposed as a technique to suppress noise to achieve the Heisenberg limit of precision.

Zhou et al. \cite{arXiv:1706.02445} showed that if the signal Hamiltonian obeys certain conditions dependent on the noise, then a quantum error-correcting code can be constructed which suppresses the noise and allows for Heisenberg limit precision in parameter estimation. The conditions are both necessary and sufficient, and can be summarized as follows: the signal Hamiltonian must be outside the span generated by the Lindblad operators \( L_j\), their adjoints \( L_j^{\dagger}\), inner products \( L_j^{\dagger}L_k\) and the Identity operator. This is referred to as the Hamiltonian-Not-In-Lindblad-Span condition (HNLS). The optimal code in this case can be found using a semi-definite program.

The protocol suggests to evolve the quantum probe under the signal Hamiltonian over a short time interval, then perform error-correction before evolving over the next time interval. This process is repeated and effectively simulates noise-free evolution as any errors are corrected along the way. The HNLS condition ensures the signal Hamiltonian is sufficiently distinguishable from the noise and is not lost in the process of error-correction.'

  encoders:
    - 'The original paper by Zhou et al. \cite{arXiv:1706.02445} required fast, noiseless ancillary qubits for constructing the error-correcting code.'
    - 'A later result by Layden et al \cite{arXiv:1811.01450} showed that in cases where the signal Hamiltonian commutes with the noise operators, ancillas are no longer needed.'
    - 'In \cite{arXiv:1706.02445}, the optimal code-words \(\tilde{\boldsymbol{\rho}}^{0}\), \(\tilde{\boldsymbol{\rho}}^{1}\) are constructed by solving the following semi-definite program, solving for $\tilde{\boldsymbol{\rho}}=\tilde{\boldsymbol{\rho}}^{0}-\tilde{\boldsymbol{\rho}}^{1}$ which maximizes the energy difference between the two encoded states : $$\begin{array}{ll} \underset{\rho}{\operatorname{maximize}} & \operatorname{Tr}(\boldsymbol{\rho} H) \\ \text { subject to } & \operatorname{Tr}(|\boldsymbol{\rho}|) \leq 2, \text { and } \operatorname{Tr}\left(\boldsymbol{\rho} O_{P}\right)=0 \forall O_{P} \in \mathcal{S} . \end{array}$$. Here H is the signal Hamiltonian, \(\mathcal{S}\) refers to the Lindblad span, and \(\O_P\) is any operator belonging to the span.'

realizations:
  - 'A simpler quantum metrology protocol using repeated error-correction was experimentally performed using NV (nitrogen-vacancy) centres by Unden et al.(2016)\cite{arXiv:1602.07144}, where a single qubit was encoded with one ancillary qubit. An ancillary long-lived nuclear spin is added, to correct phase errors on a sensitive electron spin in diamond. \cite{arXiv:1602.07144}'

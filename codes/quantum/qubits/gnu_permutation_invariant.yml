code_id: gnu_permutation_invariant
physical: qubits
logical: qubits

name: 'GNU permutation-invariant code'
introduced: '\cite{arXiv:1302.3247}'

description: |
  Can be expressed in terms of Dicke states where the logical states are
  \begin{align}
  |\overline{\pm}\rangle = \sum_{\ell=0}^{n} \frac{(\pm 1)^\ell}{\sqrt{2^n}} \sqrt{n \choose \ell} |D^m_{g \ell}\rangle~.
  \end{align}
  Here, \(m\) is the number of particles used for encoding \(1\) qubit, and \(g, n \leq m\) are arbitrary positive integers. The state \(|D^m_w\rangle\) is a Dicke state -- a normalized permutation-invariant state on \(m\) qubits with \(w\) excitations, i.e., a normalized sum over all basis elements with \(w\) ones and \(m - w\) zeroes.

  A qudit extension of such codes, based on a correspondence with binomial codes, exists \cite{arXiv:1708.05010}.

protection: 'Depends on the family. One family which is completely symmetrized versions of Bacon-Shor codes (parameterized by \(t\)) protects against arbitrary weight-\(t\) qubit errors. Additionally, codes with large enough length \((t+1)(3t+1)+t\) can approximately correct \(t\) spontaneous decay errors.'

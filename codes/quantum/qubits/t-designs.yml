description: 'A state has topological quantum order if there exists an orthogonal state which cannot be distinguished from it by local measurements. In this code, the code states are a pair of approximately topologically ordered states produced by starting with any two orthogonal states on \(n\) qubits and acting with random local circuits of depth \(\leq 10^9 n\).'

protection: 'Protects approximately against a set of errors localized to a region of size \(n/4\) with \(n\) physical qubits. Deviations from ideal quantum error correction conditions are exponentially suppressed in \(n\).'

features:

  # The fields below relate to specific properties of the code that are worth
  # noting. In some cases (see below), there might be multiple pieces of
  # information associated with a field (e.g., mutliple encoders/decoders,
  # multiple facts about fault tolerance, etc.); in such cases, the field
  # accepts a list of text entries, with one item per piece of information.
  #
  # Any fields below should be omitted if they do not apply.

#  rate: 'k/n, usually listed for a family of codes, but can be notable for a single one. Discussed alongside other parameters such as check operator weight, distance, etc.'

  # This field that starts a list of strings, indexed by a dash; do not leave it
  # empty. If empty, comment out.
  encoders: 
    - 'random local circuit of depth \(\leq 10^9 n\)'

#  decoders: 
#    - 'MWPM decoding algorithm \cite{doi:good-paper} with ... overhead.'
#    - 'Just-in-time decoder with ... \cite{arxiv:awesome-paper}.'

#realizations:
  # List and explain the different "domains" of realizations in list items.
  # Group closely related realizations into a single item. It's OK to have a
  # single list item. Each item should more or less correspond to what would be
  # said in a paragraph.

#relations:
#  parents:
#    - code_id: code_id1
#      detail: 'code_id1 is smallest code family that includes this code that is defined over the same physical space structure or alphabet'
#    - code_id: code_id2
#      detail: 'code_id2 is a code family that is constructed in a seemingly different way than this code, yet still includes this code.'
#    - code_id: code_id3
#      detail: 'code_id3 is code family described by a property shared by this code other than physical space (e.g., topological)'
#  cousins:
#    - code_id: code_id4
#      detail: 'code_id4 are other codes of similar encoding but with different physical space structures (classical or quantum)'
#    - code_id: code_id5
#      detail: 'code_id5 are codes from other families that could also be constructed this way. This entry goes into the code family that is ''smaller''.'

name: 'Fiber Bundle Codes'

introduced: '\cite{arxiv:2009.03921}'

description: 'Broadly speaking, fiber bundle codes are constructed by taking the twisted product of two classical codes. Here, the product refers to the tensor product of two chain complexes, which each represent a classical code. In a twisted product, one of the codes is called the base and remains fixed while the other, called the fiber, undergoes various automorphisms. More specifically, the boundary map for the resulting chain complex applies an automorphism to the fiber whenever base cells are mapped to their boundary cell. These twists can improve the x distance of the quantum code. Distance balancing \cite{arxiv:1611.03790} is then used to increase the z distance to be equal to the x distance. This can produce QLDPC codes that break the \(\text{polylog}(n)\sqrt{n}\) distance barrier as in Hastings, Haah, and O’Donnell’s construction \cite{arxiv:2009.03921}.'

code_id: ramanujan_tensor_product
physical: qubits
logical: qubits

name: 'Ramanujan tensor-product'

introduced: '\cite{arXiv:2004.07935}'

description: 'A quantum codes constructed from Ramanujan quantum codes and an asymptotically good classical LDPC code using distance balancing. Ramanujan quantum codes are defined using Ramanujan complexes which are simplicial complexes that generalise Ramanujan graphs. \cite{arXiv:2004.07935} proved that in principle a Ramanujan complex can yield quantum LDPC code with \(d_x =\Omega(log^j n)\) and \(d_z = \Omega (n)\). Combining the quantum code obtained from a Ramanujan complex and a good classical LDPC code, which can be thought of as coming from a 1-dimensional chain complex, yields a new quantum code that is defined on a 2-dimensional chain complex. This 2-dimensional chain complex is obtained by the co-complex of the product of the 2 co-complexes. The length, dimension and distance of the new quantum code depends on the input codes \cite{arXiv:2004.07935}.'

protection: 'For 2D Ramanujan complexes, codes protect against errors with minimum distance \(D = \Omega(\sqrt(N log(N))\). For 3D Ramanujan complexes, codes protect against errors with minimum distance \(D= \Omega(N^{1/2}\log(N))\) \cite{arXiv:2004.07935}.'

features:

  rate: 'For 2D, the rate is \(\Omega(\sqrt(\frac{1}{N\log(N)}))\), with minimum distance \(D = \Omega(\sqrt(N log(N))\). For 3D, the rate is \(\Omega(\frac{1}{\sqrt(N)\log(N))\) with minimum distance \(d \geq \sqrt(n) \log(n)\) \cite{arXiv:2004.07935}.'

  decoders:
    - 'For 2d simplicial complexes, cycle code decoder which is a polynomial time algorithm can be used \cite{rXiv:2004.07935}.'

notes:
  - 'Breaks the Freedman et al. lower bound on scaling of minimum distance \cite{doi:10.1103/PRXQuantum.2.040101}.'
  - 'Uses distance balancing \cite{arXiv:1611.03790} to increase distance of code.'

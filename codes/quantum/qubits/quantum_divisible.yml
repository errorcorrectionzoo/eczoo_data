name: 'Quantum divisible code'
introduced: '\cite{arXiv:2204.13176}'

description: |
  Consider a CSS code whose \(Z\)-stabilizers are determined by the dual of a classical \([n, k_1]\) linear binary code \(C_1\), and whose \(X\)-stabilizers are determined by a classical \([n, k_2]\) binary code \(C_2 \subset C_1\). This code is quantum divisible if all weights in \(C_2\) share a common divisor \(\Delta > 1\), and all weights in each coset of \(C_2\) in \(C_1\) are congruent to \(\Delta\).

  For example, if \(C_2\) is the first-order Reed-Muller code, and \(C_1/ C_2\) consists of quadratic forms with a bounded rank, then \([[n = 2m − 1, 1 \leq k \leq 1 + \sum_{i=1}^{m-4}(m − i), d = 3]]\) is a family of quantum divisible codes.

protection: 'Distance \(d\) is upper bounded by the two classical codes that determine the CSS code.'

features:
  general_gates:
    - 'The \([[2m − 1, 1 \leq k \leq 1 + \sum_{i=1}^{m-4}(m − i), 3]]\) quantum divisible code family can serve as outer codes of either the five-qubit \([[5,1,3]]\) or Steane \([[7,1,3]]\) code to realize a \(T\) gate on the inner code. For example, when \(m=5\) (\(m=6\)), the resulting \([[31,5,3]]\) (\([[63,7,3]]\)) code yields the \(T\) gate on the inner five-qubit (Steane) code.'

  fault_tolerance:
    - 'The \(T\) gate realized by concatenating members of the \([[2m − 1, 1 \leq k \leq 1 + \sum_{i=1}^{m-4}(m − i), 3]]\) quantum divisible code family with either the five-qubit \([[5,1,3]]\) or Steane \([[7,1,3]]\) code is fault-tolerant and does not require magic-state distillation. The gate is performed on the inner five-qubit/Steane code and does require encoding and decoding algorithms to pass between the inner and outer codes.'

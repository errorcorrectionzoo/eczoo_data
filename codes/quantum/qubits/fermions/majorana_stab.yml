name: 'Majorana stabilizer code'

introduced: '\cite{arXiv:1004.3791}'

description: |
  A stabilizer code whose stabilizers are products of an even number of Majorana fermion operators, analogous to Pauli strings for a traditional stabilizer code and referred to as \textit{Majorana stabilizers}.
  The codespace is the mutual \(+1\) eigenspace of all Majorana stabilizers.
  In such systems, Majorana fermions may either be considered individually or paired into creation and annihilation operators for fermionic modes.
  Codes can be denoted as \([[n,k,d]]_{f}\) \cite{arXiv:1703.00459}, where \(n\) is the number of fermionic modes.

  In some cases, Majorana-based stabilizer codes are designed to protect against fermionic noise \cite{arXiv:cond-mat/0010440} and are thus useful for physical platforms based on fermions.
  In other cases, Majorana-based frameworks are helpful for understanding conventional qubit stabilizer codes designed for qubit-based platforms.

# f in subscript should be bold, but this requires changing mathjax input

protection: 'Detects products of Majorana operators with weight up to \(d-1\). Physically, protects against dephasing errors caused by coupling of fermion density to the environment and bit-flip errors caused by quasiparticle poisoning processes.'

      detail: |
        The Majorana stabilizer code is a stabilizer code whose stabilizers are composed of Majorana fermion operators.
        In addition, any \([[n,k,d]]\) stabilizer code can be mapped into a \([[2n,k,2d]]_{f}\) Majorana stabilizer code \cite{arXiv:cond-mat/0506438,arXiv:1004.3791}.

  cousins:
    - code_id: dual
      detail: 'Classical self-orthogonal codes can be used to construct Majorana stabilizer codes \cite{arXiv:1703.00459}. The direct relationship between the two codes follows from expressing the Majorana strings as binary vectors – akin to the \hyperref[topic:binary-symplectic-representation]{binary symplectic representation} – and observing that the binary stabilizer matrix \(S\) for such a Majorana stabilizer code satisfies \(S\cdot S^T=0\) because it has commuting stabilizers, which is precisely the condition \(G\cdot G^T=0\) on the generator matrix \(G\) of a self-orthogonal classical code. A self-orthogonal classical code \(C\) with parameters \([2N,k,d]\) yields a Majorana stabilizer code with parameters \([[N,N-k,d^\perp]]_f\), where \(d^\perp\) is the code distance of the dual code \(C^\perp\).'
    - code_id: qubit_css
      detail: 'When constructing a Majorana stabilizer code from a self-orthogonal classical code with an odd number of bits and generator matrix \(G\), a more complex procedure must be applied to ensure that the fermion code has an even number of Majorana zero modes, and thus a physical Hilbert space \cite{arXiv:1004.3791,arXiv:1703.00459}. Rather than taking \(G\) to be the stabilizer matrix as in the even case, we take \(G\oplus G\). This is a concatenation of classical codes as in the CSS construction and it yields a mapping \([2N-1,k,d]\rightarrow [[2N-1,2N-1-k,d^\perp]]_f\). This procedure may be further generalized by concatenating two different self-orthogonal classical codes with an odd number of bits, as is often done in the CSS construction.'
    - code_id: binary_cyclic
      detail: 'Cyclic binary linear codes can be used to construct translation-invariant Majorana stabilizer codes, provided that they are also self-orthogonal \cite{arXiv:1703.00459}.'
    - code_id: reed_muller
      detail: 'Majorana stabilizer codes can be constructed by self-orthogonal RM codes \cite{arXiv:1703.00459}. These codes have the additional property that the global fermion parity is fixed in the codespace. In this family of codes, logical measurements are reduced to parity measurements of some subset of Majorana fermions in the code.'
    - code_id: stabilizer
      detail: 'Majorana stabilizer codes are useful for Majorana-based architectures, where the degrees of freedom are electrons, and the notion of locality is different than all other code kingdoms.'

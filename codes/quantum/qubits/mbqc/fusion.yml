short_name: 'FBQC'
introduced: '\cite{arXiv:2101.09310}'

description: |
  Code whose codewords are resource states used in an FBQC scheme. Related to a cluster state via Hadamard transformations.

  FBQC is a fault tolerant way to produce \textit{fusion networks}, or large entangled resource states starting from small constant-sized entangled resource states along with destructive measurements called \textit{fusions}.
  These large states can be produced asychronously in the fusion framework and can be used as resources, as in measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC), or as logical states of topological codes.
  The difference from ordinary MBQC is that error-correction two-qubit measurements are performed, which requires a foliation with more qubits.
  The use of two-qubit measurements makes FBQC more compatible with photonic platforms.

protection: 'Protects against erasure, Pauli errors, photon loss, fusion failure from non-determinism, and faulty resource states. Redundancy in fusion outcomes is captured by the check operator group. Fusion measurement outcomes form a syndrome that allows to correct for Pauli errors. There is no physical error correction, and decoding output is simply used to update the Pauli frame.'

features:
  encoders:
    - 'Resource state generators, which produce small constant size cluster states, and Fusion measurements (Bell fusions).'

  general_gates:
    - 'Clifford gates are performed by creating topological features such as boundaries, defects, or twists, which can be done by single qubit measurements.
    Logical gates can also be performed by code deformation.

    Non Clifford gates are perfomed by magic-state injection.'

    # - 'Logical Clifford operations can be kept track of using the classical Pauli-frame register and need not be explicitly applied at the quantum level.'

#  decoders:
#    - 'Logical timescales are separated from the physical measurement timescales.'
#    - 'Decoding syndrome information is tracked in the Pauli frame.'

  fault_tolerance:
    - 'Fusion networks are constructed in a fault tolerant way (as a stabilizer code), and they can be created in a way that naturally encodes topological fault tolerance.'

  threshold:
    - '\(11.98\%\) against erasure in fusion measurements.'
    - '\(1.07\%\) against Pauli error.'
    - 'In linear optical systems, can tolerate \(10.4\%\) probability of photon loss in each fusion.'
    - '\(43.2\%\) against fusion failure.'
    - 'FBQC applied to the surface code yields thresholds for logical gates that is consistent with the code capacity threshold \cite{arxiv:2112.12160}.'

  parents:
    - code_id: qubit_stabilizer
      detail: 'The resource states in FBQC are small stabilizer states, and after fusion measurements, the outputs are stabilizers (conditioned on measurement outcomes).'
  cousins:
    - code_id: topological
      detail: 'Arbitrary topological codes can be created using FBQC, as can topological features such as defects and boundaries, by modifying fusion measurements or adding single qubit measurements.'
    - code_id: dual_rail
      detail: 'FBQC resource states are concatenated with dual-rail codes to increase loss detection.'
    - code_id: dynamic_gen
      detail: 'Building a fusion network is done using a measurement-based dynamical process.'

code_id: xzzx
physical: qubits
logical: qubits

name: XZZX surface code
introduced: \cite{arXiv:2009.07851}

description: Non-CSS derivative of the surface code whose generators are \(XZXZ\)
  Pauli strings associated, clock-wise, to the vertices of each face of a two-dimensional
  lattice (with a qubit located at each vertex of the tessellation).

protection: As a stabilizer code, \([[n=O(d^2), k=O(1), d]]\).

features:
  threshold:
    - '\(\sim 4.5\%\) using minimum-weight perfect matching decoder for depolarizing noise (bias \(\eta=0.5\)); \(\sim 10\%\) for infinite \(Z\) bias.'
  code_capacity_threshold:
    - '\(50\%\) threshold for noise infinitely biased towards \(X\) or \(Y\) or \(Z\) errors using a maximum-likelihood decoder.'
    - 'For large but finite \(X\)- or \(Z\)-biased noise, the code''s thresholds exceed the zero-rate hashing bound.  The difference of the threshold from the hashing bound exceeds \(2.9\%\) at a \(Z\) or \(X\) bias of 300.'
    - '\(18.7\%\) for standard depolarising noise with maximum-likelihood decoder.'
    - '\(0.817\%\) and \(0.940\%\) with minimum-weight perfect matching and belief-matching decoder, respectively, for biased circuit-level noise \cite{arxiv:2203.04948}.'
  decoders:
    - 'Minimum-weight perfect matching decoder, which can be used for \(X\) and \(Z\) noise. For \(Y\) noise, a variant of the matching decoder could be used like it is used for the XY code in Ref. \cite{arXiv:1907.02554}.'

notes:
  - 'A single \(X\) or \(Z\) error gives rise to two nearby defects, which can be viewed as endpoints of a string. That way, multiple \(Z\) errors can be decomposed into a combination of diagonal strings.'
  - Originally formulated as an example of \(\mathbb{Z}_2\) topological order in the Wen plaquette model \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/0205004}.
relations:
  parents:
    - code_id: clifford-deformed_surface
      detail: XZZX code is obtained from the surface code by applying Hadamard gates on a subset of qubits such that \(XXXX\) and \(ZZZZ\) generators are both mapped to \(XZXZ\).
  cousins:
    - code_id: fracton
      detail: Subsystem symmetries play a role in finite-bias decoders for both codes \cite{arXiv:1901.08061}.
    - code_id: topological_abelian
      detail: Example of \(\mathbb{Z}_2\) topological order in the Wen plaquette model \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/0205004}.

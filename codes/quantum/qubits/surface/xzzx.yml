code_id: xzzx
physical: qubits
logical: qubits

name: \(XZZX\) surface code
introduced: \cite{arXiv:2009.07851}

description: Non-CSS derivative of the surface code whose generators are \(XZXZ\)
  Pauli strings associated, clock-wise, to the vertices of each face of a two-dimensional
  lattice (with a qubit located at each vertex of the tessellation).

protection: As a stabilizer code, \([[n=O(d^2), k=O(1), d]]\).

features:
  threshold:
    - \(\sim 4.5\%\) using minimum-weight perfect matching decoder for depolarizing noise (bias \(eta=0.5\)); \(\sim 10\%\) for infinite \(Z\) bias.
  code_capacity_threshold:
    - \(50\%\) threshold for noise infinitely biased towards \(X\) or \(Y\) or \(Z\) errors using a maximum-likelihood decoder.
    - For large but finite \(X\)- or \(Z\)-biased noise, the code's thresholds exceed the zero-rate hashing bound. The difference between the threshold and hashing bound exceeds \(2.9\%\) when the \(X\) (or \(Z\)) error is \(300\) times more frequent than other Paulis.
    - \(18.7\%\) at standard depolarising noise with a maximum-likelihood decoder.
  decoders:
    - Minimum weight perfect matching decoder, which can be used for \(X\) and \(Z\) noise. For \(Y\) noise, a variant of the matching decoder could be used like it is used for the \(XY\) code in Ref. \cite{arXiv:1907.02554}.

notes:
  - 'A single \(X\) or \(Z\) error gives rise to two nearby defects, which can be viewed as endpoints of a string. That way, multiple \(Z\) errors can be decomposed into a combination of diagonal strings.'
  - Originally formulated as an example of \(\mathbb{Z}_2\) topological order in the Wen plaquette model \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/0205004}.

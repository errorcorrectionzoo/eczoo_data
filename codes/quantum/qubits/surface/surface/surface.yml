name: 'Kitaev surface code'
introduced: |
  \cite{doi:10.1070/RM1997v052n06ABEH002155,doi:10.1007/978-1-4615-5923-8_19,arXiv:quant-ph/9707021}

description: |
  A family of abelian topological \hyperref[code:css]{CSS stabilizer} codes
  whose generators are few-body \(X\)-type and \(Z\)-type Pauli strings
  associated to the stars and plaquettes, respectively, of a cellulation of a
  two-dimensional surface (with a qubit located at each edge of the
  cellulation). \textit{Toric code} often either refers to the construction on
  the two-dimensional torus or is an alternative name for the general
  construction. The construction on surfaces with boundaries is often called the
  \textit{planar code} \cite{arXiv:quant-ph/9811052}.

  The original construction can be naturally extended to arbitrary dimensional
  manifolds
  \cite{doi:10.1201/9781420035377-13,doi:10.1007/978-3-642-01877-0_21}. Given a
  cellulation, qubits are put on \(i\)-dimensional faces, \(X\)-type stabilizers
  are associated with \((i-1)\)-faces, while \(Z\)-type stabilizers are
  associated with \(i+1\)-faces.

  The stabilizers of the surface code on the 2-dimensional torus are generated
  by star operators \(A_v\) and plaquette operators \(B_p\).  Each star operator
  is a product of four Pauli-\(X\) operators on the edges adjacent to a vertex
  \(v\) of the lattice; each plaquette operator is a product of four Pauli-\(Z\)
  operators applied to the edges adjacent to a face, or plaquette, \(p\) of the
  lattice (\ref{figure:toric-code-operators}).

  \begin{figure}
    \includegraphics{toric-code-operators}
    \caption{Stabilizer generators and logical operators of the 2D surface
      code on a torus.  The star operators \(A_v\) and the plaquette operators
      \(B_p\) generate the stabilizer group of the toric code.  The logical
      operators are strings that wrap around the torus.}
    \label{figure:toric-code-operators}
  \end{figure}

  The two-dimensional toric code encodes two logical qubits.  We denote by
  \(\overline{X}_i,\overline{Z}_i\) the logical Pauli-\(X\) and Pauli-\(Z\)
  operator of the \(i\)-th logical qubit.  They can are represented by strings
  of Pauli-\(X\) operators or Pauli-\(Z\) operators that wrap around the torus
  as shown in \ref{figure:toric-code-operators}.



protection: |
  Toric code on an \(L\times L\) torus is a \([[2L^2,2,L]]\) CSS code, and there
  exists a planar code with \([[L^2,1,L]]\) \cite{arxiv:1111.4022}. More
  generally, the code distance is related to the homology of the cellulation
  \cite{arXiv:quant-ph/0110143}.

features:
  rate: |
    Rate depends on the underlying cellulation and manifold. For general 2D
    manifolds, \(kd^2\leq c(\log k)^2 n\) for some constant \(c\)
    \cite{arXiv:1301.6588}, meaning that (1) 2D surface codes with bounded
    geometry have distance scaling at most as \(O(\sqrt{n})\)
    \cite{arXiv:0909.5200,doi:10.1063/1.4726034}, and (2) surface codes with
    finite rate can only achieve an asymptotic minimum distance that is
    logarithmic in \(n\). Higher-dimensional hyperbolic manifolds (see code
    children below) yield distances scaling more favorably. Loewner's theorem
    provides an upper bound for any bounded-geometry surface code
    \cite{doi:10.1201/9781420035377-13}.

  transversal_gates: |
    Transversal Pauli gates exist and are based on non-trivial loops on surface.
    Transversal Clifford gates can be done on folded surface codes \cite{arxiv:1603.02286}.

  general_gates:
    - |
      Clifford gates can be implemented via lattice surgery
      \cite{arXiv:1111.4022,arXiv:1709.02318,arXiv:1808.02892,arXiv:2109.02746},
      twist-based lattice surgery \cite{arxiv:2201.05678}, or braiding defects
      \cite{arXiv:quant-ph/0610082,arXiv:quant-ph/0703143,arXiv:1208.0928,arXiv:1609.04673}.

    - |
      Non-Clifford gates require magic state distillation
      \cite{arXiv:1905.06903}, Dehn twists \cite{arxiv:1806.06078}, or
      just-in-time decoding \cite{arXiv:1903.11634}.

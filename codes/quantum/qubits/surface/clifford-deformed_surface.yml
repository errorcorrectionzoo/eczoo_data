code_id: clifford-deformed_surface
physical: qubits
logical: qubits

name: Clifford-deformed surface code (CDSC)
introduced: \cite{arxiv:2201.07802}

description: 'A generally non-CSS derivative of the surface code defined by applying a constant-depth Clifford circuit to the original (CSS) surface code. Unlike the surface code, CDSCs include codes whose thresholds and subthreshold performance are enhanced under noise biased towards dephasing. Examples of CDSCs include the \(XY\) code, \(XZZX\) code, and random CDSCs.'

protection: As a stabilizer code, \([[n=O(d^2), k=O(1), d]]\).

features:
  fault_tolerance:
  - In order to leverage the benefits of CDSCs into practical universal computation,
    we have to implement syndrome measurement circuits and fault-tolerant logical
    gates in a bias-preserving way.
  code_capacity_threshold:
  - 'A class of random CDSCs, parametrized by the probabilities \(\Pi_{XZ},~ \Pi_{YZ}\)
    of \(X\leftrightarrow Z\) and \(Y\leftrightarrow Z\) Pauli permutations, respectively,
    has \(50\%\) code capacity threshold at infinite \(Z\) bias.'
  - 'Certain translation-invariant CDSCs such as the \(XY\) code and the \(XZZX\) code also have \(50\%\)
    code capacity threshold at infinite \(Z\) bias.'
  - '\(XZZX\) code and the \((0.5,\Pi_{YZ})\) random CDSCs have a \(50\%\) code capacity threshold for noise infinitely biased towards either Pauli-\(X\), \(Y\), or \(Z\) errors.'

  - code_id: topological_abelian
    detail: 'Local deformations of the surface code preserve its \(\mathbb{Z}_2\) topological order.'
  cousins:
  - code_id: dynamic_gen
    detail: 'To create CDSCs, a dynamical process is applied on top of the surface code.'

code_id: ramanujan_tensor_product
physical: qubits
logical: qubits

name: 'Ramanujan tensor-product code'
introduced: '\cite{arXiv:2004.07935}'

description: 'Constructed from a Ramanujan quantum code and an asymptotically good classical LDPC code using distance balancing. Ramanujan quantum codes are defined using Ramanujan complexes which are simplicial complexes that generalise Ramanujan graphs. Combining the quantum code obtained from a Ramanujan complex and a good classical LDPC code, which can be thought of as coming from a 1-dimensional chain complex, yields a new quantum code that is defined on a 2-dimensional chain complex. This 2-dimensional chain complex is obtained by the co-complex of the product of the 2 co-complexes. The length, dimension and distance of the new quantum code depend on the input codes.'

protection: 'Without distance balancing, a Ramanujan code can have \(d_X =\Omega(\log n)\) and \(d_Z = \Omega (n)\). For 2D Ramanujan complexes, distance-balanced codes protect against errors with minimum distance \(d = \Omega(\sqrt{n \log n}\). For 3D Ramanujan complexes, distance-balanced codes protect against errors with minimum distance \(d= \Omega(n^{1/2}\log n )\).'

features:

  rate: 'For 2D Ramanujan complexes, the rate is \(\Omega(\sqrt{ \frac{1}{n \log n} })\), with minimum distance \(d = \Omega(\sqrt{n \log n}) \). For 3D, the rate is \( \Omega(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}\log n}) \) with minimum distance \(d \geq \sqrt{n} \log n \).'

  decoders:
    - 'For 2D simplicial complexes, cycle code decoder admitting a polynomial-time decoding algorithm can be used \cite{arXiv:2004.07935}.'

notes:
  - 'Codes were first to break a 20-year record set by the \hyperref[code:freedman_meyer_luo]{Freedman-Meyer-Luo code} for the lower bound on scaling of the minimum distance \cite{arXiv:2103.06309}.'

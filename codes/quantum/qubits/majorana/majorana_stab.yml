name: 'Majorana stabilizer code'
introduced: '\cite{arxiv:1004.3791}'

# n is number of fermionic modes, so mult by 2 to get number of Majorana modes
description: |
  A stabilizer code whose stabilizers are products of an even number of Majorana fermion operators, analogous to Pauli strings for a traditional stabilizer code and referred to as \textit{Majorana stabilizers}.
  The codespace is the mutual \(+1\) eigenspace of all Majorana stabilizers.

  Codes can be denoted as \([[n,k,d]]_{f}\) \cite{arxiv:1703.00459}, where \(n\) is the number of fermionic modes (equivalently, \(2n\) Majorana modes).
  Two copies of an \(n\)-Majorana mode code may be combined to form a single \(n\)-fermion code by using one copy for the real parts of each fermion, and the other copy for the imaginary parts \cite{arxiv:2411.08955}.
  Codes that admit a logical operator of even (odd) weight are called even (odd) Majorana codes \cite{arxiv:2508.09928}.
  Even Majorana codes encode logical qubits, and odd Majorana codes have at least one logical Majorana fermion.

  In some cases, Majorana-based stabilizer codes are designed to protect against fermionic noise \cite{arxiv:cond-mat/0010440} and are thus useful for physical platforms based on fermions.
  In other cases, Majorana-based frameworks are helpful for understanding conventional qubit stabilizer codes designed for qubit-based platforms.

protection: |
  Detects products of Majorana operators with weight up to \(d-1\).
  Physically, protects against dephasing errors caused by coupling of fermion density to the environment and bit-flip errors caused by quasiparticle poisoning processes.

  Code bounds have been developed for small codes \cite{arxiv:1703.00612}.
  LP bounds for Majorana codes have been developed based on the identification of Majorana operators with the Clifford algebra \cite{arxiv:2502.14165}.

        A Majorana stabilizer code is a stabilizer code whose stabilizers are composed of Majorana fermion operators, which are in turn realizable using Pauli strings via the Jordan-Wigner mapping.
        Any \([[n,k,d]]\) stabilizer code can be mapped into a \([[2n,k,2d]]_{f}\) Majorana stabilizer code by concatenating with the tetron code \cite{arxiv:cond-mat/0506438}\cite[Lemma 1]{arxiv:1004.3791}.
        Embedding each physical qubit into two fermions via the tetron code is useful for exactly solving the Kitaev honeycomb model Hamiltonian \cite{arxiv:cond-mat/0506438} and other qubit Hamiltonians on certain graphs \cite{arxiv:2003.05465,arxiv:2012.07857}.
        Majorana stabilizer groups can be converted into ordinary qubit stabilizer groups via the parton mapping, while their corresponding states are converted via the Gutzwiller projection \cite{arxiv:2505.02683}.
  cousins:
    - code_id: dual
      detail: 'Classical self-orthogonal codes can be used to construct Majorana stabilizer codes \cite{arxiv:1703.00459,doi:10.1088/1751-8113/41/14/145304,arxiv:2503.08736}. The direct relationship between the two codes follows from expressing the Majorana strings as binary vectors – akin to the \hyperref[topic:binary-symplectic-representation]{symplectic representation} – and observing that the binary stabilizer matrix \(S\) for such a Majorana stabilizer code satisfies \(S\cdot S^T=0\) because it has commuting stabilizers, which is precisely the condition \(G\cdot G^T=0\) on the generator matrix \(G\) of a self-orthogonal classical code. A self-orthogonal classical code \(C\) with parameters \([2N,k,d]\) yields a Majorana stabilizer code with parameters \([[N,N-k,d^\perp]]_f\), where \(d^\perp\) is the code distance of the dual code \(C^\perp\).'
    - code_id: qubit_css
      detail: 'Every \([[n,k,d]]_f\) Majorana stabilizer code is associated with a \([[2n,2k,d]]\) self-dual qubit CSS code \cite[Lemma 2]{arxiv:1004.3791}.'
    - code_id: binary_linear
      detail: 'When constructing a Majorana stabilizer code from a self-orthogonal classical code with an odd number of bits and generator matrix \(G\), a more complex procedure must be applied to ensure that the fermion code has an even number of Majorana zero modes, and thus a physical Hilbert space \cite{arxiv:1004.3791,arxiv:1703.00459}. Rather than taking \(G\) to be the stabilizer matrix as in the even case, we take \(G\oplus G\). This is a concatenation of classical codes as in the CSS construction and it yields a mapping \([2n-1,k,d]\rightarrow [[2n-1,2n-1-k,d^\perp]]_f\). This procedure may be further generalized by concatenating two different self-orthogonal classical codes with an odd number of bits, as is often done in the CSS construction.'
    - code_id: binary_cyclic
      detail: 'Cyclic binary linear codes can be used to construct translation-invariant Majorana stabilizer codes, provided that they are also self-orthogonal \cite{arxiv:1703.00459}.'
    - code_id: stabilizer
      detail: 'Majorana stabilizer codes are useful for Majorana-based architectures, where the degrees of freedom are electrons, and the notion of locality is different than all other code kingdoms.'

      detail: 'Majorana stabilizer codes can be extended to modular qudits, yielding parafermion stabilizer codes \cite{arxiv:1409.4724}.'

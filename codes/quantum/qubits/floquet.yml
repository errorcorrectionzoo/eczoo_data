code_id: floquet
physical: qubits
logical: qubits

name: 'Floquet code'
introduced: '\cite{arXiv:2107.02194}'

description: |
  Dynamically-generated stabilizer-based code whose logical qubits are generated through a particular sequence of measurements such that the number of logical qubits is larger than when the code is viewed as a static subsystem stabilizer code. The code space is the \(+1\) eigenspace of the instantaneous stabilizer group (ISG). The ISG specifies the state of the system as a Pauli stabilizer state at a particular round of measurement, and it evolves into a (potentially) different ISG depending on the check operators measured. As opposed to subsystem codes, only specific measurement sequences maintain the codespace.

protection: 'Protects against single-qubit Pauli noise and check operator measurement errors.'

      detail: 'Both Floquet and monitored random circuit codes can have an instantaneous stabilizer group which evolves through unitary evolution and measurements. However, Floquet codewords are generated via a specific sequence of measurements, while random-circuit codes maintain a stabilizer group after any measurement. Floquet codes have the additional capability of detecting errors induced during the measurement process; see Appx. A of Ref. \cite{arxiv:2107.02194}.'

features:

  # The fields below relate to specific properties of the code that are worth
  # noting. In some cases (see below), there might be multiple pieces of
  # information associated with a field (e.g., mutliple encoders/decoders,
  # multiple facts about fault tolerance, etc.); in such cases, the field
  # accepts a list of text entries, with one item per piece of information.
  #
  # Any fields below should be omitted if they do not apply.

 # rate: 'k/n, usually listed for a family of codes, but can be notable for a single one. Discussed alongside other parameters such as check operator weight, distance, etc.'

  # This field that starts a list of strings, indexed by a dash; do not leave it
  # empty. If empty, comment out.

code_id: tfim
physical: qubits
logical: qubits

name: 'Transverse-field Ising model (TFIM) code'
short_name: 'TFIM'
introduced: '\cite{arXiv:2205.12998}'

description: 'A 1D translationally invariant stabilizer code whose encoding is a constant-depth circuit of nearest-neighbor gates on alternating even and odd bonds that consist of transverse-field Ising Hamiltonian interactions. The code allows for perfect state transfer of arbitrary distance using local operations and classical communications (LOCC).'

protection: 'Code distance is 1 for open boundary conditions similar to a repetition code, and 3 for periodic boundary conditions with an encoding circuit depth of 4.'

features:
  encoders:
    - '1D geometrically local constant-depth brickwork circuit of nearest-neighbor gates on alternating even and odd bonds. Gates are generated by interaction terms of the transverse-field Ising Hamiltonian.'

      detail: 'The TFIM code stabilizers can be expressed in terms of Majorana operators.'
    - code_id: quantum_repetition
      detail: 'When written in the computational basis, the phase-flip and TFIM codewords are superpositions of qubit states of fixed total parity. The superposition is equal for the phase-flip code, whereas some states appear with a \(-1\) coefficient for TFIM code. However, the TFIM code can be encoded in constant depth.'

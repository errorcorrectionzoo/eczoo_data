code_id: small_distance_qubit_stabilizer

name: 'Small-distance qubit stabilizer code'

description: |
  A qubit stabilizer code that either detects or corrects errors on at most two subsystems, i.e., have distance \(\leq 5\).

  All single error-correcting qubit stabilizer codes have been classified \cite{arxiv:0901.1968}. Qubit stabilizer codes for \(n < 10\) have been classified \cite{arxiv:2501.17447}, all of which have small distance. Qubit stabilizer codes have been partially enumerated up to twelve qubits \cite{arxiv:2009.01244}.

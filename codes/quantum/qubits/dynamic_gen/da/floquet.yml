code_id: floquet
physical: qubits
logical: qubits

name: 'Hastings-Haah Floquet code'
short_name: 'Floquet'
introduced: '\cite{arXiv:2107.02194}'

description: |
  DA code whose sequence of check-operator measurements is periodic.

# In addition, the number of logical qubits is larger than when the code is viewed as a static subsystem stabilizer code.

protection: 'Protects against single-qubit Pauli noise and check operator measurement errors.'

features:
  fault_tolerance:
    - 'Floquet codes on tri-colorable lattices can be made fault-tolerant in the presence of dead qubits \cite{arxiv:2307.03715}.'

relations:
  parents:
    - code_id: da
      detail: 'Floquet codes are DA codes with periodic measurement sequences.'
  cousins:
    - code_id: subsystem_stabilizer
      detail: 'This code can be viewed as a subsystem stabilizer code, albeit one with less logical qubits.'
    - code_id: monitored_random_circuits
      detail: 'Both Floquet and monitored random circuit codes can have an instantaneous stabilizer group which evolves through unitary evolution and measurements. However, Floquet codewords are generated via a specific sequence of measurements, while random-circuit codes maintain a stabilizer group after any measurement. Floquet codes have the additional capability of detecting errors induced during the measurement process; see Appx. A of Ref. \cite{arxiv:2107.02194}.'
    - code_id: majorana_stab
      detail: 'Floquet codes are viable candidates for storage in Majorana-qubit devices \cite{arxiv:2202.11829}.'

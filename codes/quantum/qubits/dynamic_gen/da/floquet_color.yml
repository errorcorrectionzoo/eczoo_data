physical: qubits
logical: qubits

name: 'Floquet color code'
introduced: '\cite{doi:10.26081/K6F65V,arxiv:2210.02468,arxiv:2212.00042}'

alternative_names:
  - 'CSS Floquet toric code'
  - '\(\mathbb{Z}_2\) Floquet code'
  - 'CSS honeycomb code'

description: |
  Floquet code on a trivalent lattice whose parent topological phase is the \(\mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_2\) 2D color-code phase and whose measurements cycle logical quantum information between the three \(\mathbb{Z}_2\) surface-code \hyperref[topic:code-switching]{condensed phases} of the parent phase.
  The code's ISG is the stabilizer group of one of the three surface codes.

# Once you build the group, are remaining msmnts just automorphisms? Might be related to gauge switching / code deformation. It is not really reversible, but ISG's are automoprhic. Topologically, you start with Z2 x Z2 color code phase and condense to Z2, then uncondense and condense to a different Z2 to get a different ISG.
#
# How does SG of color relate to one of the three ISGs?
#
# FLoquet codes are built from measuring more stabilizers + "establishing" the full ISG.
# Switching between condensed phases is like code deformation

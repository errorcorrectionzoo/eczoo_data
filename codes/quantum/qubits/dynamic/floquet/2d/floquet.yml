code_id: floquet
physical: qubits
logical: qubits

name: 'Hastings-Haah Floquet code'
short_name: 'Floquet'
introduced: '\cite{arxiv:2107.02194}'

description: |
  2D dynamical code whose sequence of check-operator measurements is periodic.
  The first instance of a dynamical code.

# In addition, the number of logical qubits is larger than when the code is viewed as a static subsystem stabilizer code.

protection: 'Protects against single-qubit Pauli noise and check operator measurement errors.'

features:
  fault_tolerance:
    - 'Floquet codes on tri-colorable lattices can be made fault-tolerant in the presence of dead qubits \cite{arxiv:2307.03715,arxiv:2405.15854}.'

relations:
  parents:
    - code_id: da
      detail: 'Floquet codes are dynamical codes with periodic measurement sequences.'
    - code_id: qudit_honeycomb
      detail: 'The modular-qudit honeycomb Floquet code reduces to the Hastings-Haah Floquet code for \(q=2\).'
  cousins:
    - code_id: subsystem_stabilizer
      detail: 'This code can be viewed as a subsystem stabilizer code, albeit one with less logical qubits.'
    - code_id: monitored_random_circuits
      detail: 'Both Floquet and monitored random circuit codes can have an instantaneous stabilizer group which evolves through unitary evolution and measurements. However, Floquet codewords are generated via a specific periodic sequence of measurements, while random-circuit codes maintain a stabilizer group after any measurement. Floquet codes have the additional capability of detecting errors induced during the measurement process; see Appx. A of Ref. \cite{arxiv:2107.02194}.'
    - code_id: majorana_stab
      detail: 'Floquet codes are viable candidates for storage in Majorana-qubit devices \cite{arxiv:2202.11829}.'
    - code_id: qubit_stabilizer
      detail: |
        Using ZX calculus, an \([[n,k,d]]\) qubit stabilizer code admitting stabilizer generators of weight no more than \(m\) can be \textit{Floquetified} into an \([[n+\lceil m/2 \rceil+\ell,k,d^{\prime}]]\) dynamical code with single- and two-qubit operations, where \(\ell \leq \log_{2} m\) and \(d^{\prime} \geq d\) \cite{arxiv:2410.17240} (see also Ref. \cite{arxiv:2307.11136}). 
        A more general locality-preserving \textit{spacetime concatenation} procedure yields a dynamical code out of any qubit stabilizer code by structuring measurement gadgets using low-weight measurements while ensuring the preservation of logical information \cite{arxiv:2504.08918}. 
        In particular, spacetime concatenation reformulates the notion of a dynamical code associated with a stabilizer code in terms of code concatenation for every qubit (spatial concatenation) and measurements between these codes (temporal concatenation), leading to a temporal evolution of the stabilizer state \cite{arxiv:2504.08918}. 
        A matrix rank condition on the bond operators connecting the gadgets, called the Bond-Kernel-Rank Condition, and a strict locality preservation condition (SLPC), along with preservation of the operator algebra of the stabilizer code under the gadget action, preserves fault-tolerance and the spacetime distance of the code \cite{arxiv:2504.08918}.

code_id: floquet_xyz_ruby
physical: qubits
logical: qubits

name: 'XYZ ruby Floquet code'
introduced: '\cite{arxiv:2407.08566}'

description: |
  2D Floquet code whose qubits are placed on vertices of a ruby tiling.
  Its weight-two check operators are placed on various edges.
  One third of the time during its measurement schedule, its ISG is that of the 6.6.6 color code concatenated with a three-qubit repetition code.
  Together, all ISGs generate the gauge group of the 3F subsystem code.
  A Floquet code with the same underlying subsystem code but with a different measurement schedule was developed in Ref. \cite{arxiv:2307.13668}.
# from Ref. \cite{arxiv:0908.4246}, whose logical operators .

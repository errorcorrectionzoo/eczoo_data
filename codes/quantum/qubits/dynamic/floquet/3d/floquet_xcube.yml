code_id: floquet_xcube
physical: qubits
logical: qubits

name: 'X-cube Floquet code'
introduced: '\cite{arxiv:2211.05784}'

description: |
  3D Floquet code whose qubits are placed on vertices of a truncated cubic honeycomb.
  Its weight-two check operators are placed on various edges.
  Its ISG can be that of the X-cube model code or that of several decoupled surface codes.
  A rewinding of the original measurement sequence yields a period-six sequence whose ISGs are those of the X-cube model, some 3D surface codes, and some decoupled surface codes \cite{arxiv:2307.13668}.

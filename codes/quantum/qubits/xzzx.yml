code_id: xzzx
physical: qubits
logical: qubits

name: 'XZZX surface code'
introduced: '\cite{arXiv:2009.07851}'

description: 'A family of stabilizer codes whose generators are \(XZXZ\) Pauli strings associated, clock-wise, to the vertices of each face of a two-dimensional lattice (with a qubit located at each vertex of the tessellation).'

protection: 'As a stabilizer code, \([[n=O(d^2), k=O(1), d]]\).'

notes:
  - 'A single \(X\) or \(Z\) error gives rise to two nearby defects, which can be viewed as endpoints of a string. That way, multiple \(Z\) errors can be decomposed into a combination of diagonal strings.'
  #- 'A single \(Z\) error gives rise to a defect at each adjacent face.'

features:
  threshold:
  - '\(50\%\) with pure \(X\) or \(Z\) errors and both a maximum-likelihood decoder and a minimum-weight perfect-matching decoder.'
  - '\(18.7\%\) at standard depolarising noise with a maximum-likelihood decoder.'
  - |
    For large but finite \(X\)- or \(Z\)-biased noise, the code's thresholds exceed the zero-rate hashing bound.
    The gap exceeds \(2.9\%\) when \(X\) (\(Z\)) error is \(300\) times more frequent than other Paulis.

notes:
  - 'Originally formulated as an example of \(\mathbb{Z}_2\) topological order in the Wen plaquette model \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/0205004}.'

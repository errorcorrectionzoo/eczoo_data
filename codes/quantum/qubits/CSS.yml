name: 'Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) stabilizer code'
introduced: '\cite{arXiv:quant-ph/9512032,doi:10.1103/PhysRevLett.77.793,arXiv:quant-ph/9601029}'

description: |
  An \([[n,k,d]]\) stabilizer code whose stabilizer generators are either \(Z\)-type or \(X\)-type Pauli strings. The parity check matrix is of the form
  \begin{align}
  H=\begin{pmatrix}0 & H_{Z}\\
  H_{X} & 0
  \end{pmatrix}~.
  \label{eq:parity}
  \end{align}
  Encoding is based on two \hyperref[code:binary_linear]{binary linear codes}, an \([n,k_X,d_X]\) code \(C_X\) and \([n,k_Z,d_Z]\) code \(C_Z\) with \(C_X^\perp \subseteq C_Z\), such that \(k=k_X+k_Z-n\) and \(d\geq\min\{d_X,d_Z\}\). The \(H_X\) (\(H_Z\)) block of \(H\) \eqref{eq:parity} is associated with the code \(C_X\) (\(C_Z\)), and the requirement \(C_X^\perp \subseteq C_Z\) guarantees that the \(X\)-stabilizers of \(C_X\) commute with the \(Z\)-stabilizers of \(C_Z\).

  A CSS code has \textit{stabilizer weight} \(w\) if the highest weight of any stabilizer generator is \(w\), i.e., any row and column of \(H_X\) and \(H_Z\) has weight at most \(w\). In the context of comparing weight as well as of noise models biased toward \(X\)- or \(Z\)-type errors, an extended notation for CSS codes is \([[n,k,(d_X,d_Z),w]]\).

protection: 'Detects errors on \(d-1\) qubits, corrects errors on \(\left\lfloor (d-1)/2 \right\rfloor\) qubits.'

notes:
  - 'Original requirement of \(C_X^\perp \subset C_Z\) \cite{arXiv:quant-ph/9512032} has been relaxed to absorb \hyperref[code:hypergraph_product]{hypergraph product} codes.'

      detail: 'Stabilizer generators can be expressed as either only \(X\)-type or only \(Z\)-type. However, any \([[n,k,d]]\) stabilizer code can be mapped onto a \([[4n,2k,2d]]\) weakly self-dual CSS code, with the mapping preserving geometric locality of a code up to a constant factor \cite{arXiv:1004.3791}.'

      detail: 'Movassagh-Ouyang codes stem from a prescription that converts at \textit{arbitrary} classical code into a quantum code.'
  cousins:
    - code_id: binary_linear
      detail: 'Construction uses two related binary linear codes (\C_X\) and \(C_Z\).'
    - code_id: weakly_self_dual
      detail: 'CSS codes for which \(C_X=C_Z \equiv C\) are called \textit{weakly self-dual} since \(C^{\perp} \subseteq C\). The stabilizer group of such codes is invariant under the Hadamard gate exchanging \(X\) and \(Z\).'

description: |
  An \([[n,k,d]]\) stabilizer code admitting a set of stabilizer generators that are either \(Z\)-type or \(X\)-type Pauli strings. The stabilizer generator matrix is of the form
  \begin{align}
  H=\begin{pmatrix}0 & H_{Z}\\
  H_{X} & 0
  \end{pmatrix}
  \label{eq:parity}
  \end{align}
  such that the rows of the two blocks must be orthogonal
  \begin{align}
  H_X H_Z^T=0~.
  \label{eq:comm}
  \end{align}
  The above condition guarantees that the \(X\)-stabilizer generators, defined in the symplectic representation as rows of \(H_X\), commute with the \(Z\)-stabilizer generators associated with \(H_Z\).

  Encoding is based on two related \hyperref[code:binary_linear]{binary linear codes}, an \([n,k_X,d^\prime_X]\) code \(C_X\) and \([n,k_Z,d^\prime_Z]\) code \(C_Z\), satisfying \(C_X^\perp \subseteq C_Z\). The resulting CSS code has \(k=k_X+k_Z-n\) logical qubits and distance \(d\geq\min\{d^\prime_X,d^\prime_Z\}\). The \(H_X\) (\(H_Z\)) block of \(H\) \eqref{eq:parity} is the parity-check matrix of the code \(C_X\) (\(C_Z\)). The requirement \(C_X^\perp \subseteq C_Z\) guarantees \eqref{eq:comm}.
  Basis states for the code are, for \(\gamma \in C_X\),
  \begin{align}
  |\gamma + C_Z^\perp \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{|C_Z^\perp|}} \sum_{\eta \in C_Z^\perp} |\gamma + \eta\rangle.
  \end{align}

  A CSS code has \textit{stabilizer weight} \(w\) if the highest weight of any stabilizer generator is \(w\), i.e., any row of \(H_X\) and \(H_Z\) has weight at most \(w\). In the context of comparing weight as well as of determining distances for noise models biased toward \(X\)- or \(Z\)-type errors, an extended notation for CSS codes is \([[n,k,(d_X,d_Z),w]]\). The quantity \(\min\{d_X,d_Z\}\) is often called the \textit{worst-case minimum distance}.

  There exists a many-to-one mapping from size three chain complexes to CSS codes \cite{doi:10.1070/RM1997v052n06ABEH002155,arXiv:quant-ph/0605094,arXiv:1311.0885,arXiv:1802.01520} that allows one to extract code properties from topological features of the complexes. Codes constructed in this manner are sometimes called \textit{homological CSS codes}, but they are equivalent to CSS codes. This mapping of codes to manifolds allows the application of structures from topology to error correction, yielding \hyperref[code:generalized_homological_product]{various QLDPC codes} with favorable properties.

  A \textit{chain complex} of size three is given by binary vector spaces \(A_2\), \(A_1\), \(A_0\) and binary matrices \(\partial_{i=1,2}\) (called \textit{boundary operators}) \(A_i\) to \(A_{i-1}\) that satisfy \(\partial_1 \partial_2 = 0\). Such a complex is typically denoted as
  \begin{align}
  A_2 \xrightarrow{\partial_2} A_1 \xrightarrow{\partial_1} A_0~.
  \label{eq:chain}
  \end{align}
  One constructs a CSS code by associating a physical qubit to every basis element of \(A_1\), and defining parity-check matrices \(H_X=\partial_1^T\) and \(H_Z=\partial_2\)). That way, the spaces \(A_0\) and \(A_2\) can be associated with \(X\)-type and \(Z\)-type Pauli operators, respectively, and boundary operators determine the Paulis making up the stabilizer generators. The requirement \(\partial_1 \partial_2 = 0\) guarantees that the \(X\)-stabilizer generators associated with \(H_X\) commute with the \(Z\)-stabilizer generators associated with \(H_Z\).

  Usually, the chain complex \eqref{eq:chain} used in the construction comes from the chain complex associated with a cellulation of a manifold. When the manifold is a two-dimensional surface, its entire chain is used. Higher-dimensional manifolds allow for longer chain complexes, and one can use the three largest non-trivial vector spaces in its chain.

#  The reverse mapping is as follows \cite{arXiv:1311.0885,arXiv:1807.09783}. Given a CSS code with parity check matrices \(H_X\) and \(H_Z\), let both boundary operators be \(\partial = H_Z^TUH_X\) for an arbitrary invertible matrix \(U\). The fact that the stabilizer generators commute ensures that the boundary operator satisfies \(\partial^2=0\), yielding a chain complex.
#  Then, the normalizer of the stabilizers \({\mathsf{N}}(C_X)\) and \({\mathsf{N}}(C_Z)\) is \(\text{Ker}(\partial_2^T)\) and \(\text{Ker}(\partial_1)\), respectively.
# Insert table linking manifold properties to QEC
# condition Then, the code derived from a chain with this boundary operator yields classical codes \(C_X\) and \(C_Z\) with codewords in \(\text{Im}(\partial^T)\) and \(\text{Im}(\partial)\), respectively.

protection: |
  Detects errors on \(d-1\) qubits, corrects errors on \(\left\lfloor (d-1)/2 \right\rfloor\) qubits.

  Using the relation to chain complexes, the number of encoded logical qubits is equal to the dimension of the first \(\mathbb{Z}_2\)-homology of the chain complex, \(H_1(\partial, \mathbb{Z}_2) = \frac{\text{Ker}(\partial_1)}{\text{Im}(\partial_2)}\). The distance of the CSS code is equal to the minimum of the combinatorial (\(d-1\))-systole of the cellulated \(d\)-dimensional manifold and its dual.

description: |
  Also called a \textit{Pauli stabilizer code}. An \(((n,2^k,d))\) qubit stabilizer code is denoted as \([[n,k]]\) or \([[n,k,d]]\), where \(d\) is the code's distance. Logical subspace is the joint eigenspace of commuting Pauli operators forming the code's stabilizer group \(\mathsf{S}\). Traditionally, the logical subspace is the joint \(+1\) eigenspace of a set of \(2^{n-k}\) commuting Pauli operators which do not contain \(-I\).

  The distance is the minimum weight of a Pauli string that implements a nontrivial logical operation in the code.

  (Pauli matrices go here.)

  Each stabilizer code can be represented by a \((n-k) \times 2n\) stabilizer generator matrix \(H=(A|B)\), where each row \((a|b)\) is the binary symplectic representation of a stabilizer generator. (Standard form goes here.)

  Qubit stabilizer codes can be extended to modular-qudit stabilizer codes by decorating appropriate generators with powers. For example, \([[4,2,2]]\) qubit code generators can be adjusted to \(ZZZZ\) and \(XX^{-1} XX^{-1}\). A systematic procedure extending a qubit code to prime-qudit codes involves putting its generator matrix into \textit{local-dimension-invariant (LDI)} form  \cite{arxiv:1910.08122}. Various bounds exist on the distance of the resulting codes \cite{arxiv:2110.11510,arxiv:2110.15274}.

  Detects errors on up to \(d-1\) qubits, and corrects erasure errors on up to \(d-1\) qubits. More generally, define the normalizer \(\mathsf{N(S)}\) of \(\mathsf{S}\) to be the set of all operators that commute with all \(S\in\mathsf{S}\). A stabilizer code can correct a Pauli error set \({\mathcal{E}}\) if and only if \(E^\dagger F \notin \mathsf{N(S)}\setminus \mathsf{S}\) for all \(E,F \in {\mathcal{E}}\).

  A stabilizer code is geometrically local if the support of the stabilizer generators is bounded by a ball of size independent of \(n\). There is an upper bound of \(d \leq O(L^{D-1})\) on the distance \cite{arXiv:0810.1983} of geometrically local stabilizer codes arranged in a \(D\)-dimensional lattice of length \(L\) with \(n=L^D\).

    - 'Computational thresholds against stochastic local noise can be achieved through repeated use of concatenatenation, and can rely on the same small code in every level \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/9702058,arxiv:quant-ph/9906129,arXiv:quant-ph/9705031,arXiv:quant-ph/0504218}. The resulting code is highly degenerate, with all but an exponentially small fraction of generators having small weights. Circuit and measurement designs have to take case of the few stabilizer generators with large weights in order to be fault tolerant.'

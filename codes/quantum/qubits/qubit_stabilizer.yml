name: 'Qubit stabilizer code'

description: |
  Also called a \textit{Pauli stabilizer code}. An \(((n,2^k,d))\) qubit stabilizer code is denoted as \([[n,k]]\) or \([[n,k,d]]\), where \(d\) is the code's distance. Logical subspace is the joint eigenspace of commuting Pauli operators forming the code's stabilizer group \(\mathsf{S}\). Traditionally, the logical subspace is the joint \(+1\) eigenspace of a set of \(2^{n-k}\) commuting Pauli operators which do not contain \(-I\). The distance is the minimum weight of a Pauli string that implements a nontrivial logical operation in the code.

  Each stabilizer code can be represented by a \((n-k) \times 2n\) \textit{check matrix} (a.k.a. \textit{stabilizer generator matrix}) \(H=(A|B)\), where each row \((a|b)\) is the binary symplectic representation of an element from a set of generating elements of the stabilizer group. The check matrix can be brought into standard form via Gaussian elimination \cite{doi:10.1017/CBO9780511976667}.

  The stabilizer commutation condition can equivalently be stated in the symplectic representation. A pair of \(n\)-qubit stabilizers with symplectic representations \((a|b)\) and \((a^{\prime}|b^{\prime})\) commute iff their symplectic inner product is zero,
  \begin{align}
    a \cdot b^{\prime} + a^{\prime}\cdot b = \sum_{j=1}^{n} a_j b^{\prime}_j + a^{\prime}_i b_i = 0~.
  \end{align}
  Symplectic representations of stabilizer group elements thus form a self-orthogonal subspace of \(GF(2)^{2n}\) with respect to the symplectic inner product.

  Detects errors on up to \(d-1\) qubits, and corrects erasure errors on up to \(d-1\) qubits. More generally, define the normalizer \(\mathsf{N(S)}\) of \(\mathsf{S}\) to be the set of all operators that commute with all \(S\in\mathsf{S}\). A stabilizer code can correct a Pauli error set \({\mathcal{E}}\) if and only if \(E^\dagger F \notin \mathsf{N(S)}\setminus \mathsf{S}\) for all \(E,F \in {\mathcal{E}}\).

  A stabilizer code is geometrically local if the support of the stabilizer generators is bounded by a ball of size independent of \(n\). There is an upper bound of \(d \leq O(L^{D-1})\) on the distance \cite{arXiv:0810.1983} of geometrically local stabilizer codes arranged in a \(D\)-dimensional lattice of length \(L\) with \(n=L^D\).

The resulting code is highly degenerate, with all but an exponentially small fraction of generators having small weights. Circuit and measurement designs have to take case of the few stabilizer generators with large weights in order to be fault tolerant.'

Conversely, qubit codes can be extended to modular-qudit codes by decorating appropriate generators with powers. For example, \([[4,2,2]]\) qubit code generators can be adjusted to \(ZZZZ\) and \(XX^{-1} XX^{-1}\). A systematic procedure extending a qubit code to prime-qudit codes involves putting its generator matrix into local-dimension-invariant (LDI) form  \cite{arxiv:1910.08122}. Various bounds exist on the distance of the resulting codes \cite{arxiv:2110.11510,arxiv:2110.15274}.'

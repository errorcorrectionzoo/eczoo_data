code_id: eaqecc

name: 'Entanglement-assisted (EA) QECC'
short_name: 'EAQECC'
introduced: '\cite{arxiv:quant-ph/0205117,arxiv:quant-ph/0608027,arxiv:quant-ph/0610092}'

alternative_names:
  - 'Catalytic QECC'

description: 'QECC whose encoding and decoding utilizes pre-shared entanglement between sender and receiver.'

protection: |
  Pre-shared entanglement can be prepared in a way that is robust to noise \cite{arxiv:0904.1175}.

features:
  rate: |
    The EA quantum capacity is the highest rate of quantum information transmission through a quantum channel with arbitrarily small error rate and access to arbitrary amounts of entanglement \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/0106052}.
    The fault-tolerant EA capacity is the capacity for the more general case where the encoding and decoding maps are also assumed to undergo noise \cite{arxiv:2210.02939}.

notes:
  - 'See Ref. \cite{arxiv:1610.04013,doi:10.1017/CBO9781139034807.009} for an introduction to EAQECCs.'

      detail: 'An EAOAQECC that has no gauge structure (e.g., gauge qubits), that has no block structure that corresponds to a classical code, and that utilizes pre-shared entanglement is an EA QECC.'
  cousins:
    - code_id: qecc
      detail: 'EA QECCs utilize additional ancillary subsystems in a pre-shared entangled state, but reduce to QECCs when said subsystems are interpreted as noiseless physical subsystems.'
    - code_id: eacq
      detail: 'An EA hybrid QECC storing no classical information reduces to an EA QECC. Conversely, any EA QECC can be converted into an EA hybrid QECC by using a portion of its logical subspace to store only classical information.'
    - code_id: eaoecc
      detail: 'An EA subsystem QECC reduces to an EA QECC when the gauge subsystem is trivial. Conversely, any EA QECC with a tensor-product logical subspace can be turned into an EA subsystem QECC by treating a logical tensor factor as a gauge subsystem.'

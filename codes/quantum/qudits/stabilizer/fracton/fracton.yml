name: 'Fracton stabilizer code'
introduced: '\cite{arxiv:1101.1962}'

description: |
  A 3D translationally invariant modular-qudit stabilizer code whose codewords make up the ground-state space of a Hamiltonian in a fracton phase.
  Unlike topological phases, whose excitations can move in any direction, fracton phases are characterized by excitations whose movement is restricted.

  Qubit Fracton codes include the following three sub-types:
  \begin{enumerate}[(1)]
  \item \textit{Foliated type-I fracton phase}: Excitations are mobile in less than 3 dimensions, but codes can be grown by \textit{foliation}, i.e., stacking copies of the 2D surface code and applying a constant-depth circuit.
  \item \textit{Fractal type-I fracton phase}: Excitations are mobile in less than 3 dimensions, and codes are not foliated.
  \item \textit{Type-II fracton phase}: Excitations are not mobile in any dimension and there are no string operators.
  \end{enumerate}

  Fracton phases can be understood as topological defect networks, meaning that they can be described in the language of topological quantum field theory with defects \cite{arxiv:2002.05166,arxiv:2112.14717}.

 # Conversely, fracton codes need not be translationally invariant, and can realize multiple phases on one lattice.

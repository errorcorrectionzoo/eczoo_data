description: |
  An \(((n,K,d))_q\) modular-qudit stabilizer code admitting a set of stabilizer generators that
  are either \(Z\)-type or \(X\)-type Pauli strings.
  Codes can be defined from two classical codes and/or chain complexes over the ring \(\mathbb{Z}_q\) via an extension of \hyperref[topic:CSS-to-homology-correspondence]{qubit CSS-to-homology correspondence} to modular qudits.
  The homology group of the logical operators has a torsion component because the chain complexes are defined over a ring, which yields codes whose logical dimension is not a power of \(q\).

  The stabilizer generator matrix, taking values from \(\mathbb{Z}_q\), is of the form
  \begin{align}
  H=\begin{pmatrix}0 & H_{Z}\\
  H_{X} & 0
  \end{pmatrix}
  \label{eq:parityq}
  \end{align}
  such that the rows of the two blocks must be orthogonal
  \begin{align}
  H_X H_Z^T=0~.
  \label{eq:commQ}
  \end{align}
  The above condition guarantees that the \(X\)-stabilizer generators, defined in the \hyperref[topic:galois-symplectic-representation]{modular symplectic representation} as rows of \(H_X\), commute with the \(Z\)-stabilizer generators associated with \(H_Z\).

  For composite \(q\), such codes need not encode an integer number of qudits, but the relation to homology allows for a general structure theorem \cite[Thm. 8.1.1]{arxiv:2405.03559}.
  For prime \(q=p\), properties reminiscent of qubit CSS codes are restored: encoding is based on two related \hyperref[code:q-ary_linear]{\(p\)-ary linear codes}, an \([n,k_X,d_X]_p \) code \(C_X\) and \([n,k_Z,d_Z]_p \) code \(C_Z\),
  satisfying \(C_X^\perp \subseteq C_Z\). The resulting CSS code has \(k=k_X+k_Z-n\) logical qubits and distance \(d\geq\min\{d_X,d_Z\}\).
  Specializing to the case when \(C_Z=[n,k,d]_p\) is dual-containing yields an \([[n,2k-n,\geq d_Z]]_p\) \textit{self-dual prime-qudit CSS code} with \(C_X = C_Z^\perp\).
  The \(H_X\) (\(H_Z\)) block of \(H\) \eqref{eq:parityq} is the parity-check matrix of the code \(C_X\) (\(C_Z\)). The requirement \(C_X^\perp \subseteq C_Z\) guarantees \eqref{eq:commQ}.
  Basis states for the code are, for \(\gamma \in C_X\),
  \begin{align}
  |\gamma + C_Z^\perp \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{|C_Z^\perp|}} \sum_{\eta \in C_Z^\perp} |\gamma + \eta\rangle.
  \end{align}

      This construction should be extendable to additive \(q\)-ary codes over \(\mathbb{Z}_q\) since those are also groups under addition.'

name: '3D lattice stabilizer code'

description: |
  Lattice stabilizer code in three spatial dimensions.
  Qubit codes are conjectured to admit either fracton phases or abelian topological phases that are equivalent to multiple copies of the 3D surface code and/or the 3D fermionic surface code via a local constant-depth Clifford circuit \cite{arxiv:1908.08049}.

# 1. \textit{Abelian topological phase}: Excitations are mobile in all 3 dimensions, as is typical in a topological code. Such codes are conjectured to be equivalent to a \(\mathbb{Z}_2\) gauge theory, i.e., multiple copies of the 3D surface code or the 3D fermionic surface code.

name: 'Double-semion stabilizer code'
introduced: '\cite{arxiv:cond-mat/0404617,arxiv:2112.11394}'

alternative_names:
  - 'Doubled semion model code'

description: |
  A 2D lattice modular-qudit stabilizer code with qudit dimension \(q=4\) that realizes the 2D double semion topological phase.
  The code can be obtained from the \(\mathbb{Z}_4\) surface code by \hyperref[topic:code-switching]{condensing} the anyon \(e^2 m^2\) \cite{arxiv:2211.03798}.

  This stabilizer code family is inequivalent to a CSS code via a Clifford circuit whose depth does not scale with \(n\) \cite[Thm. 1.1]{arxiv:1506.08883}.
  This is because the double semion phase has a sign problem \cite{arxiv:1506.08883,arxiv:2005.05343}, and existence of such a Clifford circuit would allow one to construct a code Hamiltonian that is free of such a problem.

      detail: 'When treated as ground states of the code Hamiltonian, the double-semion stabilizer code states realize 2D double-semion topological order, a topological phase of matter that exists as the deconfined phase of the 2D twisted \(\mathbb{Z}_2\) gauge theory \cite{doi:10.1007/BF02096988}. All Abelian TQD codes can be realized as modular-qudit stabilizer codes by starting with an Abelian quantum double model along with a family of Abelian TQDs that generalize the double semion anyon theory and \hyperref[topic:code-switching]{condensing} certain bosonic anyons \cite{arxiv:2211.03798}.'

      detail: 'The exchange statistics of the anyon for the double-semion code coincides with a subset of anyons in the \(\mathbb{Z}_4\) surface code, but the fusion rules are different.
      The double-semion code can be obtained from the \(\mathbb{Z}_4\) surface code by \hyperref[topic:code-switching]{condensing} the anyon \(e^2 m^2\) \cite{arxiv:2211.03798} or by gauging \cite{arxiv:1202.3120,arxiv:1605.01640,arxiv:1806.08679,arxiv:1806.08679} the one-form symmetry associated with said anyon \cite[Footnote 20]{arxiv:2211.03798}.'

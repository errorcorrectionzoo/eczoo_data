logical: qudits

name: 'Double-semion stabilizer code'
introduced: '\cite{arXiv:cond-mat/0404617,arxiv:2112.11394}'

description: |
  Modular-qudit stabilizer code with qudit dimension \(q=4\) that is characterized by the 2D double semion topological phase.
  The code can be obtained from the \(\mathbb{Z}_4\) surface code by \hyperref[topic:code-switching]{condensing} the anyon \(e^2 m^2\) \cite{arxiv:2211.03798}.
  Originally formulated as the ground-state space of a Hamiltonian with non-commuting terms \cite{arXiv:cond-mat/0404617}, which can be extended to other spatial dimensions \cite{arxiv:1507.05676}, and later as a commuting-projector code \cite{arxiv:1810.08204,arXiv:2001.11516}.

  This stabilizer code family is inequivalent to a CSS code via a Clifford circuit whose depth does not scale with \(n\) \cite[Thm. 1.1]{arxiv:1506.08883}.
  This is because the double semion phase has a sign problem \cite{arxiv:1506.08883,arxiv:2005.05343}, and existence of such a Clifford circuit would allow one to construct a code Hamiltonian that is free of such a problem.

      detail: 'When treated as ground states of the code Hamiltonian, the code states realize double-semion topological order, a topological phase of matter that exists as the deconfined phase of the twisted \(\mathbb{Z}_2\) gauge theory in two dimensions \cite{doi:10.1007/BF02096988}.'
  cousins:
    - code_id: surface
      detail: 'The double semion phase also has a realization in terms of qubits \cite{arXiv:cond-mat/0404617} that can be compared to the qubit surface code.
      There is a logical basis for both the toric and double-semion codes where each codeword is a superposition of states corresponding to all noncontractible loops of a particular homotopy type.
      The superposition is equal for the toric code, whereas an odd number of loops appear with a \(-1\) coefficient for the double semion.'
    - code_id: qudit_surface
      detail: 'The exchange statistics of the anyon for the double-semion code coincides with a subset of anyons in the \(\mathbb{Z}_4\), but the fusion rules are different.
      The double-semion code can be obtained from the \(\mathbb{Z}_4\) surface code by \hyperref[topic:code-switching]{condensing} the anyon \(e^2 m^2\) \cite{arxiv:2211.03798} or by gauging the one-form symmetry associated with said anyon \cite[Footnote 20]{arxiv:2211.03798}.'

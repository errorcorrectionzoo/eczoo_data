code_id: quantum_double_abelian
physical: qudits
logical: qudits

name: 'Abelian quantum-double stabilizer code'
introduced: '\cite{arxiv:quant-ph/9707021}'

description: |
  Modular-qudit stabilizer code whose codewords realize 2D modular gapped Abelian topological order with trivial cocycle.
  The corresponding anyon theory is defined by an Abelian group.
  All such codes can be realized by a stack of modular-qudit surface codes because all Abelian groups are Kronecker products of cyclic groups.

  There exists an invariant that can be computed to uniquely characterize the anyons of a state in an Abelian quantum-double topological phase \cite{arxiv:1407.2926}.

protection: |
  Error-correcting properties established in Ref. \cite{arxiv:1804.03203} using operator algebra theory.
  Correcting the maximum number of correctable errors is \(NP\)-complete \cite{arxiv:2404.08552}.

features:
  encoders:
    - 'Any geometrically local unitary circuit connecting two quantum double models whose groups are not isomorphic must have depth at linear linear in \(n\) \cite{arxiv:1407.2926}.'
  decoders:
    - 'Efficient decoder correcting below the code distance \cite{arxiv:2404.08552}.'

      detail: 'The anyon theory corresponding to Abelian quantum double codes is defined by an Abelian group and trivial cocycle. All Abelian TQD codes can be realized as modular-qudit stabilizer codes by starting with an Abelian quantum double model along with a family of Abelian TQDs that generalize the double semion anyon theory and \hyperref[topic:code-switching]{condensing} certain bosonic anyons \cite{arxiv:2211.03798}. Upon gauging some symmetries \cite{arxiv:1202.3120,arxiv:1605.01640,arxiv:1806.08679,arxiv:1806.08679}, Type-I and II \(\mathbb{Z}_2^3\) TQDs realize the same topological order as certain Abelian quantum double models \cite{arxiv:hep-th/9511195,arxiv:1508.03468,arxiv:2112.12757}.'

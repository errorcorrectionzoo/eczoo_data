name: 'Modular-qudit CWS code'
introduced: '\cite{arxiv:0712.1979,arxiv:0801.0831,arxiv:0808.3086}'

description: |
  A CWS code for modular qudits, defined using a modular-qudit cluster state and a set of modular-qudit \(Z\)-type Pauli strings defined by a \(q\)-ary classical code over \(\mathbb{Z}_q\).

  The modular-qudit CWS construction takes in \( \mathcal{Q} = (\mathcal{G},\mathcal{C}) \), where \(\mathcal{G}\) is a graph, and where \(\mathcal{C}\) is an \((n,K,d)_{\mathbb{Z}_q}\) \(q\)-ary code over \(\mathbb{Z}_q\).
  From the graph, we form the modular-qudit cluster state \( |\mathcal{G} \rangle \).
  From the \(q\)-ary code, we form modular-qudit Pauli \(Z\)-type operators \( W_i = Z^{c_{i,1}} \otimes \cdots \otimes Z^{c_{i,n}} \), where \(c_{i,j} \) is the \(j\)-th coordinate of the \(i\)-th classical codeword.
  The codewords are then \( | i \rangle =  W_i | \mathcal{G} \rangle \).

  In an alternative convention (not used here), CWS codes are defined from an underlying modular-qudit stabilizer state that is not a necessarily a cluster state.

      detail: 'Any modular-qudit CWS code can be written as a modular-qudit USt whose (\(K=1\)) stabilizer code is the modular-qudit cluster state and whose coset representatives are constructed from the \(q\)-ary classical code over \(\mathbb{Z}_q\).
      Prime-dimensional modular-qudit CWS codes have a unique representation as USt codes \cite{arxiv:1303.7020}.
      Conversely, modular-qudit USt codes are equivalent to modular-qudit CWS codes via a single-Galois-qudit Clifford circuit as follows \cite{arxiv:0907.2038,manual:{Li, Yunfan. Codeword Stabilized Quantum Codes and Their Error Correction. Diss. UC Riverside, 2010.}}\cite[Sec. 10.4]{doi:10.1017/CBO9781139034807.012}.
      The set of coset representatives of any modular-qudit USt can be extended to a larger set iterating over the underlying stabilizer code such that all codewords can be obtained from a single stabilizer state.
      Then, one can apply a single-qubit Clifford transformation to map said modular-qudit stabilizer state into a modular-qudit cluster state.'

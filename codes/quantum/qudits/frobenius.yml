description: |-
  Frobenius codes also called QUANTUM CYCLIC CODES is introduced first \cite{arXiv:1011.5814}. 
  For a prime power \(q = p^k\), \(\mathbb{F}_q\) denotes the unique finite field of cardinality \(q\). The product \(\mathbb{F}_p^n\) is a vector space over the finite field \(\mathbb{F}_p\) and an element \(\mathbf{a}=(a_1,\ldots,a_n)^\mathrm{T}\) in it is thought of as a column vectors.  Fix a \(p\)-dimensional Hilbert space \(\mathcal{H}\). An orthonormal basis for \(\mathcal{H}\) is of cardinality \(p\). Fix one such basis and denote it by \(\{ \ket{a} | a \in \mathbb{F}_p \}\).  As is standard in quantum computing, for an element \(\mathbf{a}=(a_1,\ldots,a_n)^\mathrm{T}\) in \(\mathbb{F}_p^n\), \(\ket{\mathbf{a}}\) denotes the tensor product \(\ket{a_1}\otimes\ldots\otimes\ket{a_n}\).  The set \(\{ \ket{\mathbf{a}} | \mathbf{a} \in \mathbb{F}_p^n \}\) forms a basis for the \(n\)-fold tensor product \(\mathcal{H}^{\otimes^n}\). A \emph{quantum code} over \(\mathbb{F}_p\) of \emph{length} \(n\) is a subspace of the tensor product \(\mathcal{H}^{\otimes^n}\).
  An important class of quantum codes are the class of stabiliser codes. One can study stabiliser codes by studying the isotropic sets under the \emph{symplectic inner product}. For any two vectors \(\mathbf{u}=(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b})\) and \(\mathbf{v}=(\mathbf{c},\mathbf{d})\) of \(\mathbb{F}_p^{n}	imes\mathbb{F}_p^n\), define the \emph{symplectic inner product} \(\symp{\mathbf{u}}{\mathbf{v}}\) as the scalar \(	ranspose{\mathbf{a}}\mathbf{d} - 	ranspose{\mathbf{b}}\mathbf{c}\) of \(\mathbb{F}_p\).  A subset \(S\) of \(\mathbb{F}_p^{2n}\) is called \emph{totally isotropic}, or just \emph{isotropic}, if for any two elements \(\mathbf{u}\) and \(\mathbf{v}\) of \(S\), \(\symp{\mathbf{u}}{\mathbf{v}} = 0\)
  \cite{arXiv:1011.5814} describes how to created such isotropic space in detail.

  Let \( C \) be a \(t \)-Frobenius code, as in Theorem V.1 \cite{arXiv:1011.5814}, of length \( n\) and BCH distance \( \delta = 2\tau + 1 \). There is quantum algorithm that takes time polynomial in \( n \)to correct
  errors of weight at most \( \tau \)

features:
  decoders:
    - 'Adapted from the Berlekamp decoding algorithm for classical BCH codes. There exists a polynomial time quantum algorithm to correct errors of weight at most \(\tau\), where \(\delta=2\tau+1\) is the BCH distance of the code \cite{arXiv:1011.5814}. '

notes:
  - 'Frobenius codes that are also stabilizer codes have been completely classified. No such codes exist when \(t\) is odd. All such codes with even \(t\) can be directly constructed.'

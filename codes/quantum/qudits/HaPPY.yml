code_id: happy
physical: AdS bulk operators
logical: CFT boundary operators


name: 'HaPPY code'
introduced: '\cite{arxiv:1503.06237}'

description: 'Encodes operators in the bulk of the Anti de Sitter space into operators on the boundary of the corresponding Conformal Field Theory. This is accomplished using a tensor network of [[5,1,3]] and [[6,0,4]] encodings with several layers that eventually leads to the CFT on the boundary.'


protection: 'Protects against erasure errors on the boundary.'


features:
  rate: 'Converges to \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \approx 0.447\)'

  encoders:
    - 'Encoding is done through tensor pushing. Each bulk operator (logical) is pushed to an operator supported on a portion of the boundary region (physical). Pushing all the bulk operators through results in reconstruction of the boundary.'

  decoders:
    - 'Greedy algorithm for decoding specified in \(\cite{arxiv:1503.06237}\).'
    - 'Given only a fraction of the boundary operators, one can only decode (reconstruct) a portion of the bulk operators within the causal wedge.'
    - 'This is a precise analog to the AdS Rindler reconstruction.'
    - 'If there is one logical index in the bulk (a single logical qubit), physical erasure errors on the boundary can be corrected by the greedy decoder if p < 1/12.'

      detail: 'stabilizer is a code family that is constructed in a seemingly different way than this code, yet still includes this code.'

description: |
  Code whose codewords realize topological order associated with an Abelian anyon theory, equivalently, a unitary braided fusion category which is also an Abelian group under fusion \cite{arxiv:2004.12048}.

  A theory is defined by an Abelian group \(A\) of anyon types whose multiplication relations define the fusion rules, and a set of exchange statistics \(\theta(a)\in U(1)\) obtained by exchanging two anyons of type \(a\in A\).
  The exchange statistics in turn define braiding relations,
  \begin{align}
    B(a,b) = \frac{\theta(ab)}{\theta(a)\theta(b)}~,
  \end{align}
  between all anyon pairs \(a,b\).

  All 2D abelian topological orders can be understood within the subsystem stabilizer formalism \cite{arxiv:2211.03798}.
  As such, many of the operations one can perform on such codes have both a stabilizer and a topological-phase interpretation.
  Stabilizer generators of 2D topological codes acting on 1D loops of qubits can be interpreted as one-form symmetries of the underlying phase realized by the code.
  Identification of an anyon \(a\) with the vacuum is equivalent to adding string excitation operators corresponding to \(a\) to the stabilizer group and taking the center to get another stabilizer group.
  Code states of this new stabilizer code correspond to a \hyperref[topic:code-switching]{condensed phase} of the parent topological phase.
  The remaining unidentified parent-phase anyons behave differently with respect to the new condensed-phase state.
  Some become \textit{confined} while the remaining ones pick up new braiding relations.

code_id: diatomic_molecular
physical: quotients

name: 'Diatomic molecular code'
introduced: '\cite[Sec. VI]{arxiv:1911.00099}'

description: |
  Approximate quantum code that encodes a qudit in the infinite-dimensional Hilbert space of a rigid body with \(SO(2)\) symmetry (e.g., a heteronuclear diatomic molecule).
  This state space is the space of normalized functions on the two-sphere, \(L^2(S^2)\), consisting of a direct sum of all non-negative integer angular momenta.
  Ideal codewords may not be normalizable because the space is infinite-dimensional, so approximate versions have to be constructed in practice.

  Construction is based on nested subgroups \(H\subset K \subset SO(3)\), where \(H,K\) are finite.
  Codewords consist of orbits of particular position states under \(H\), while some elements of \(K\) can cycle between codewords.

protection: |
  Protects against sufficiently small shifts in position and small kicks in angular momentum.
  But unlike the original molecular codes, these codes cannot protect against all product of such shifts and kicks because the underlying state space does not form a group.

      detail: 'Diatomic molecular codes are defined on the space of orientations of a heterogeneous diatomic molecules. This is equivalent to the space of normalizable functions on the two-sphere, i.e., the symmetric space \(SO(3)/SO(2) = S^2\).'

      detail: 'Molecular (diatomic molecular) codes are constructed using two nested subgroups of \(SO(3)\) on the state space of a particle on \(SO(3)\) (the two-sphere).'

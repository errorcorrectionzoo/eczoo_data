code_id: tesselation
physical: quotients

name: 'Hyperbolic tesselation code'
introduced: '\cite{arxiv:2410.18713}'

description: |
  Approximate quantum code that encodes a qudit in the space of normalized functions on the hyperbolic plane and that is constructed using symmetry groups of planar tilings.
  Tesselation code projections are onto a copy of an irreducible representation of some group, with the code constructed using the \(\{4,3,5\}\) tesselation realizing the binary icosahedral group \(2I\) \cite{arxiv:2410.18713}.


protection: |
  Protects against sufficiently small shifts in position and momentum errors on the hyperbolic plane. Momentum errors are represented by LaPlacian eigenfunctions and are indexed by a continuous variable \cite{arxiv:2410.18713}.

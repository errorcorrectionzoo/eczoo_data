code_id: tesselation
physical: quotients

name: 'Hyperbolic tesselation code'
introduced: '\cite{arxiv:2410.18713}'

description: |
  Homogeneous-space code whose codewords are superpositions of positional delta functions on the hyperbolic phane. 
  The positions are chosen according to certain planar tessellations. 
  Tesselation code projections are onto a copy of an irreducible representation of the rotational symmetry group of the corresponding tessellation, known as the proper triangle group. The symmetry of the tesselation determines the easily implementable logical gate sets of this code.
   
  Examples are the code constructed using the \(\{4,3,5\}\) tesselation realizing the binary icosahedral group \(2I\), the code constructed using the \(\{5,5,5\}\) tesselation realizing the modular-qudit Pauli group of 5-dimensional qudit, and the code constructed using the \(\{4,6,5\}\) tesselation realizing the \hyperref[topic:clifford]{single-qubit Clifford group} \(2O\) \cite{arxiv:2410.18713}.


protection: |
  Protects against sufficiently small shifts in position and momentum errors on the hyperbolic plane. Momentum errors are represented by LaPlacian eigenfunctions and are indexed by a continuous variable \cite{arxiv:2410.18713}.

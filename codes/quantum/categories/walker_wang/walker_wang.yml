name: 'Walker-Wang model code'
introduced: '\cite{arxiv:1104.2632}'

description: |
  A 3D topological code defined by a unitary braided fusion category \( \mathcal{C} \) (also known as a unitary premodular category).
  The code is defined on a cubic lattice that is resolved to be trivalent, with a qudit of dimension \( |\mathcal{C}| \) located at each edge.
  The codespace is the ground-state subspace of the Walker-Wang model Hamiltonian \cite{arxiv:1104.2632} and realizes the Crane-Yetter model \cite{arxiv:hep-th/9301062,arxiv:hep-th/9309063,arxiv:hep-th/9409167}.
  A single-state version of the code provides a resource state for MBQC \cite{arxiv:2011.04693}.

protection: |
  Codespace dimensions (i.e., ground-state degeneracy) has been calculated for various boundary conditions \cite{arxiv:1208.5128}.

features:
  encoders:
    - 'For modular chiral anyon theories, a unitary encoder is conjectured to not be implementable in constant depth because it is believed to be an example of a \textit{quantum cellular automaton} (QCA) (i.e., causal or locality-preserving automorphism) that cannot be locally implemented \cite{arxiv:1812.01625,arxiv:2205.09141}.
    States of modular gapped theories can be initialized in constant depth \cite{arxiv:2208.03397}.'

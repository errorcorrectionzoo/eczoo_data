physical: categories
logical: categories

name: 'Groupoid toric code'
introduced: '\cite{arxiv:2212.01021}'

description: |
  Extension of the Kitaev surface code from Abelian groups to groupoids, i.e., multi-fusion categories in which every morphism is an isomorphism \cite{doi:10.1112/blms/19.2.113}.
  Some models admit fracton-like features such as extensive ground-state degeneracy and excitations with restricted mobility.
  The robustness of these features has not yet been established.

  parents:
    - code_id: enriched_string_net
      detail: 'Groupoid toric-code categories are unitary multi-fusion categories based on matrix algebras \cite{arxiv:1412.6589}, so groupoid toric codes can equivalently be formulated as multi-fusion string-net codes.'
  cousins:
    - code_id: fracton
      detail: 'Some groupiod toric code models admit fracton-like features such as extensive ground-state degeneracy and excitations with restricted mobility.'

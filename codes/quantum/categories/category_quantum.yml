name: 'Category-based quantum code'

description: |
  Encodes a finite-dimensional \textit{logical} Hilbert space into a \textit{physical} Hilbert space associated with a category.
  The categories of interest are typically fusion categories, which subsume all finite groups and many state spaces associated with topological codes. 
  Codes on modular fusion categories are often associated with a particular topological quantum field theory (TQFT), as the data of such theories is described by such categories.

name: 'String-net code'
introduced: '\cite{arxiv:cond-mat/0404617,arxiv:0907.2204,arxiv:1002.2816,arxiv:2004.07045}'

alternative_names:
  - 'Levin-Wen model code'
  - 'Turaev-Viro code'

description: |
  A non-stabilizer commuting-projector code whose codewords realize a 2D topological order rendered by a Turaev-Viro topological field theory.
  The corresponding anyon theory is defined by a (multiplicity-free) unitary fusion category \( \mathcal{C} \).
  The code is defined on a cell decomposition dual to a triangulation of a two-dimensional surface, with a qudit of dimension \( |\mathcal{C}| \) located at each edge of the decomposition.
  These models realize local topological order (LTO) \cite{arxiv:2307.12552}.

  The codespace is the ground-state subspace of the Levin-Wen model commuting-projector Hamiltonian \cite{arxiv:cond-mat/0404617}, a many-body Hamiltonian realizing the 3-manifold Turaev-Viro invariant \cite{arxiv:1002.2816,arxiv:1106.6033}.
  This Hamiltonian is defined to act on a constrained Hilbert space defined by vertex constraints.
  Alternative constructions are possible, encoding information in the fusion space of the low-energy anyonic quasiparticle excitations of the model \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/0001108,arxiv:1002.2816}.
  The fusion space can have dimension greater than one, allowing for topological quantum computation of logical information stored in the fusion outcomes.
  Domain walls of string nets can be formulated using bimodule categories \cite{arxiv:2008.11187}.
  Anyon condensation of general string net models is studied in Ref. \cite{arxiv:2303.04711}.

  The initial formulation of string-net models \cite{arxiv:cond-mat/0404617} considered unitary fusion categories with an extra tetrahedral symmetry, but this was realized not to be necessary \cite{arxiv:0907.2204,arxiv:1002.2816}.
  Explicit Hamiltonians for the more general categories have been studied \cite{arxiv:2004.07045}.

    - 'For an \(L\times L\) lattice, deterministic state preparation can be done with a geometrically local unitary \(O(L)\)-depth circuit \cite{arxiv:2110.02020} or an \(O(\log{L})\)-depth unitary circuit with non-local two-qubit gates \cite{arxiv:0712.0348,arxiv:0806.4583}.'

  general_gates:
    - 'Gates can be implemented through topological operations corresponding to elements of the mapping class group, which is generated by Dehn-twists along non-contractible cycles for triangulations of toroidal \cite{arxiv:1806.02358,arxiv:1806.06078} and hyperbolic \cite{arxiv:1901.11029} manifolds.
    Whether or not a gate set is universal depends on the choice of input category; in some cases such as the Ising category, gates can be complemented by topological charge measurements to obtain a universal gate set.'
    - 'Alternatively, one could encode the logical quantum information into the degenerate fusion space of a number of computational anyons. In this case, a universal logical gate set can be implemented through the braiding of the computational anyons \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/0001108,arxiv:math/0103200,arxiv:1002.2816}, e.g., for the case of the \hyperref[code:fibonacci]{Fibonacci} input category.'

      detail: 'String-net codes realize 2D topological phases based on unitary fusion categories. Any 2D many-body state satisfying the entanglement bootstrap axioms can be mapped into the ground-state subspace of a string-net model via a constant-depth unitary circuit \cite{arxiv:2405.17379}. Different string-net models that have Morita-equivalent input fusion categories describing the same topological order are dual to each other \cite{arxiv:2408.02664}.'

name: 'Walker-Wang model code'
introduced: '\cite{arxiv:1104.2632}'

description: |
  A 3D topological code defined by a unitary braided fusion category \( \mathcal{C} \) (also known as a unitary premodular category).
  The code is defined on a cubic lattice that is resolved to be trivalent, with a qudit of dimension \( |\mathcal{C}| \) located at each edge.
  The codespace is the ground-state subspace of the Walker-Wang model Hamiltonian \cite{arxiv:1104.2632}.
  A single-state version of the code provides a resource state for MBQC \cite{arxiv:2011.04693}.

features:
  encoders:
    - 'For modular chiral anyon theories, a unitary encoder is conjectured to not be implementable in constant depth because it is believed to be an example of a quantum cellular automaton (i.e., causal or locality-preserving automorphism) that cannot be locally implemented \cite{arxiv:1812.01625,arxiv:2205.09141}.
    States of modular gapped gapped theories can be initialized in constant depth \cite{arxiv:2208.03397}.'

      detail: 'Walker-Wang model codes can be realized using Walker-Wang model Hamiltonians, which realize 3D topological phases based on unitary braided fusion categories.'

      detail: 'The Walker-Wang model is a generalization of the 3D version of the Levin-Wen model \cite[Sec. 5]{arxiv:cond-mat/0404617}, which realizes gauge theories coupled with bosons and fermions.'

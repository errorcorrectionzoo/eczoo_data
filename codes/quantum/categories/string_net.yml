name: 'String-net code'
introduced: '\cite{arxiv:cond-mat/0404617,arxiv:1002.2816}'

description: |
  Also called a \textit{Turaev-Viro} or \textit{Levin-Wen model} code. A family of topological codes, defined by a finite unitary spherical category \( \mathcal{C} \),  whose generators are few-body operators acting on a cell decomposition dual to a triangulation of a two-dimensional surface (with a qudit of dimension \( |\mathcal{C}| \) located at each edge of the decomposition).

  The codespace is the ground-state subspace of the Levin-Wen model Hamiltonian \cite{arxiv:cond-mat/0404617}, a many-body Hamiltonian realizing the 3-manifold Turaev-Viro invariant \cite{arxiv:1002.2816,arxiv:1106.6033}. Alternative constructions are possible, encoding information in the fusion space of the low-energy anyonic quasiparticle excitations of the model \cite{arXiv:quant-ph/0001108,arxiv:1002.2816}. The fusion space can have dimension greater than one, allowing for topological quantum computation of logical information stored in the fusion outcomes.

features:
  general_gates:
  - Gates can be implemented through topological operations corresponding
    to elements of the mapping class group, which is generated by Dehn-twists along
    non-contractible cycles for triangulations of toroidal \cite{arXiv:1806.02358,arxiv:1806.06078} and hyperbolic \cite{arXiv:1901.11029} manifolds.
    Whether or not a gate set is universal depends on the choice of input category; in some cases such as the Ising category, gates can be complemented by topological charge measurements to obtain a universal gate set.
  - Alternatively, one could encode the logical quantum information into the degenerate
    fusion space of a number of computational anyons. In this case, a universal logical
    gate set can be implemented through the braiding of the computational anyons \cite{arXiv:quant-ph/0001108,arXiv:math/0103200,arxiv:1002.2816}, e.g., for the case of the \hyperref[code:fibonacci]{Fibonacci} input category.

  - Syndrome measurement circuits analyzed in Ref. \cite{arXiv:1206.6048}.

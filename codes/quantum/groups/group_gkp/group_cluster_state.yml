name: 'Group-based cluster-state code'
introduced: '\cite{arxiv:1408.6237}'

description: |
  A code based on a group-based cluster state for a group \(G\) \cite{arxiv:1408.6237}.
  Such cluster states can be defined using a graph and conditional group multiplication operations.
  A group-based cluster state for \(G=GF(q)\) for prime-power \(q\) is called a \textit{Galois-qudit cluster state}, while the state for \(G=\mathbb{Z}_q\) for positive \(q\) is called a modular-qudit cluster state.

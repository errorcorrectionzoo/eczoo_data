description: |
  Group-based code whose codewords realize 2D modular gapped topological order defined by a finite group \(G\).
  The code's generators are few-body operators associated to the stars and plaquettes, respectively, of a tessellation of a two-dimensional surface (with a qudit of dimension \( |G| \) located at each edge of the tesselation).
  The original Hamiltonian can be re-expressed via \hyperref[topic:group-pauli]{group-based right- and left-multiplication \(X\)-type as well as \(Z\)-type error} operators \cite[Sec. 3.3]{arxiv:2111.12096}.

  The physical Hilbert space has dimension \( |G|^E  \), where \( E \) is the number of  edges in the tessellation. The dimension of the code space is the number of orbits of the conjugation action of \( G \) on \( \text{Hom}(\pi_1(\Sigma),G) \), the set of group homomorphisms from the fundamental group of the surface \( \Sigma \) into the finite group \( G \) \cite{arxiv:1908.02829,arxiv:2509.10876} (see also Ref. \cite{arxiv:0909.3305}). When \( G \) is Abelian, the formula for the dimension simplifies to \( |G|^{2g} \), where \( g \) is the genus of the surface \( \Sigma \).

  The codespace is the ground-state subspace of the quantum double model Hamiltonian, while local excitations are characterized by anyons.
  Different types of anyons are labeled by irreducible representations of the group's quantum double algebra, \(D(G)\) (a.k.a. Drinfield center) \cite{arxiv:1006.5479,arxiv:2310.19661}.
  Not all isomorphic non-Abelian groups give rise to different quantum doubles \cite{arxiv:math/0605530}.

  For non-Abelian groups, alternative constructions are possible, encoding information in the fusion space of the low-energy anyonic quasiparticle excitations of the model \cite{doi:10.1007/3-540-49208-9_31,arxiv:quant-ph/0306063,doi:10.1017/CBO9780511792908}.
  The fusion space of such non-Abelian anyons has dimension greater than one, allowing for topological quantum computation of logical information stored in the fusion outcomes.

  Gapped boundaries of the models are classified by a subgroup \(K \subseteq G\) and a two-cocycle \cite{arxiv:0712.0190,arxiv:1006.5479,arxiv:1706.03611,arxiv:2204.05341}.

  Error-correcting properties established in Ref. \cite{arxiv:1908.02829}.
  The code distance is the number of edges in the shortest non contractible cycle in the tesselation or dual tesselation  \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/0110143}.
  These models realize local topological order (LTO) \cite{arxiv:2309.13440}.

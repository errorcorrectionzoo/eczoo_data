description: |
  A geometrically local stabilizer code with sites organized on a lattice modeled by the additive group \(\mathbb{Z}^D\) for spatial dimension \(D\).
  On an infinite lattice, its stabilizer group is generated by few-site Pauli-type operators and their translations, in which case the code is called \textit{translationally invariant stabilizer code}.
  Boundary conditions have to be imposed on the lattice in order to obtain finite-dimensional versions.
  Lattice defects and boundaries between different codes can also be introduced.

  \subsection{Modular- and Galois-qudit lattice stabilizer codes}

  Translationally-invariant prime-qudit (\(q=p\)) stabilizer codes with \(m\) qudits per unit cell have been classified in dimensions \(D\in\{1,2\}\) in the thermodynamic limit, up to equivalence under local constant-depth Clifford circuits.
  Any 1D (2D) code can be converted to several copies of the 1D repetition code (prime-qudit 2D surface code) along with some trivial codes \cite{arxiv:1607.01387} (\cite{arxiv:1812.11193}).
  See 3D lattice stabilizer code entry for the 3D classification.

  \begin{defterm}{Pauli-to-polynomial mapping}
  \label{topic:quantum-polynomial-mapping}
  A single modular- or Galois-qudit Pauli operator can be specified by the lattice coordinate of the site and the symplectic vector
  representation of the Pauli operator within the site.
  In an extension of the sympletic representation, each lattice coordinate can be represented by a Laurent monomial of \(D\) formal variables. For example, when \(D=2\) and \(m=1\), the product of an \(X\) acting on the qubit at lattice coordinate \((-1,2)\) and a \(Z\) acting on the qubit at \((1,0)\) can be represented by the vector \( (x^{-1} y^2 | x) \). The multiplicative group of finitely supported Pauli operators modulo phase factors on the lattice of dimension \(D\) with \(m\) prime-dimensional qubits per site is isomorphic to the additive group of Laurent polynomial column vectors of length \(2m\) in \(D\) formal variables (see Ref. \cite{arxiv:1607.01387} and Sec. IV of Ref. \cite{arxiv:1812.01625}).

  For periodic boundary conditions, this mapping can be thought of as a quantum extension of the \hyperref[topic:Cyclic-to-polynomial-correspondence]{cyclic-to-polynomial correspondence}.
  For open boundary conditions, this mapping extends the mapping used in quantum convolutional codes to multiple spatial dimensions.

  \subsection{Bosonic lattice stabilizer codes}

  Bosonic lattice stabilizer codes can contain discrete or continuous subgroups and can admit logical qudit and/or oscillator logical subspaces.
  Such codes can realize topological phases of matter that are expected not to be realizable with qudit stabilizer codes \cite{arxiv:2411.04993}. 


protection: |
  A quantity called the recoverable information, defined for lattice stabilizer codes, is a measure of the non-locality of the encoding that is complementary to the topological entanglement entropy \cite{arxiv:1712.02375}.


#The code is specified by a stabilizer group that is generated by site-local Pauli operators and is translationally invariant with respect to the lattice.
#As an example with \(p = 2\) and \(D = 3\), \(P(1, 2, 3; e_1)P(-1, 2, 4; e_{q+2})\) is the Pauli operator that applies \(X\) to
#  qubit \(1\) of lattice point \((1, 2, 3)\) and applies \(Z\) to qubit \(2\) of lattice point \((-1, 2, 4)\). This operator can be
#  equivalently expressed by the Laurent polynomial \(x_1x_2^2x_3^3e_1 + x_1^{-1}x_2^2x_3^4e_{q+2}\).

    \begin{defterm}{BPT bound}
    \label{topic:bpt-bound}
    Qubit stabilizer code parameters on \(D\)-dimensional Euclidean lattices are limited by the \textit{Bravyi-Poulin-Terhal (BPT) bound} \cite{arxiv:0909.5200} (see also \cite{arxiv:0810.1983,arxiv:1008.1029,arxiv:1610.06169}), which states that \(d = O(n^{1-1/D})\) (the original \textit{Bravyi-Terhal (BT) bound} \cite{arxiv:0810.1983}) and that \(k d^{2/(D-1)} = O(n)\) (using \hyperref[topic:asymptotics]{asymptotic notation}).
    Codes on a \(D\)-dimensional homogeneous Riemannian manifold with diameter \(L\) satisfy \(k = O(L^{D-2})\) \cite{arxiv:2009.13551}.
    Some non-locality is necessary to circumvent these bounds \cite{arxiv:2409.15203}.
    The bound does not apply to stabilizer circuits: a fault-tolerant quantum computation scheme exists for a 1D qubit lattice with nearest-neighbor connectivity \cite{arxiv:2502.16132}.
    Codes for \(D < 2\) have constant distance \cite{arxiv:2503.17655}.

  general_gates:
    - '\begin{defterm}{Bravyi-Koenig bound}
      \label{topic:bk-bound}
      Logical gates implemented via constant-depth quantum circuits on a \(D\)-dimensional lattice stabilizer code whose distance increases at least logarithmically with \(n\) lie in the \(D\)th level of the \term{Clifford hierarchy} \cite{arxiv:1206.1609}.
      A refinement can be made that expresses the bound in terms of higher-group symmetries of the topological phases underlying the codes \cite[Sec. 5.4.2]{arxiv:2211.11764}.
      The theorem has been made robust \cite{arxiv:2503.04566}.
      Conversely, the distance of a code on an \(L^{D}\) lattice is upper bounded by \hyperref[topic:asymptotics]{order} \(O(L^{D+1-\nu})\) if the code implements an \(\nu\)th-level \term{Clifford hierarchy} gate \cite{arxiv:1408.1720}.
      The code capacity threshold of such a code family is upper bounded by \(1/\nu\) \cite{arxiv:1408.1720}.

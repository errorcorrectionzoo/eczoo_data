code_id: generalized_homological_product
# Now includes rotors

name: 'Generalized homological-product code'

description: |
  Stabilizer code whose properties are determined from an underlying chain complex, which often consists of some type of product of other chain complexes.
  The \ref{topic:CSS-to-homology-correspondence} yields an interpretation of codes in terms of manifolds, thus allowing for the use of various products from topology in constructing codes.

  The codes participating in the product can be quantum, classical, or mixed.
  Homology can be used to design codes for qubits, modular qudits, Galois qudits, as well as rotors; most codes are CSS codes.
  However, products can be of more than two underlying codes, in which case the output code need not be CSS (e.g., for \hyperref[code:xyz_product]{XYZ product codes}).

  The simplest product is a tensor product, with more general products imposing equivalence or symmetry relations on the outputs of the tensor product.
  A product of two codes can be interpreted as a fiber bundle, with one element of the product being the base and the other being the fiber.

      detail: 'Homological products are a primary tool for generating QLDPC codes with favorable parameters. Typically, whenever the input codes are LDPC or QLDPC, the resulting code will be QLDPC with non geometrically local stabilizer generators.'

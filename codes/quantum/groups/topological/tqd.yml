name: 'Twisted quantum double (TQD) code'
short_name: 'TQD'
introduced: '\cite{doi:10.1016/0920-5632(91)90123-V,arxiv:1211.3695,arxiv:2107.13091}'

description: |
  Code whose codewords realize a 2D topological order rendered by a Chern-Simons topological field theory.
  The corresponding anyon theory is defined by a finite group \(G\) and a Type-III group cocycle \(\omega\), but can also be described in a category theoretic way \cite{arxiv:0705.0665}.

  Logical dimension is determined by the genus of the underlying surface (for closed surfaces), types of boundaries (for open surfaces), and any twist defects present.
  Excitations are described by the twisted quantum double (a.k.a. twisted Drinfield double) \(D^{\omega}(G)\).
  Gapped boundaries of the models are classified by a subgroup \(K \subseteq G\) and a particular two-cochain \cite{arxiv:1706.03611}.

protection: |
  These models realize local topological order (LTO) \cite{arxiv:2411.08675}.

    - 'For any solvable group \(G\), ground-state preparation can be done with an adaptive constant-depth circuit with geometrically local gates and measurements throughout \cite{arxiv:2209.06202}.'

        Restricting Dijkgraaf-Witten gauge theory to a 2D manifold reproduces the phase of the TQD model \cite{arxiv:0705.0665}.
        The Drinfield center of the category \(\text{Vec}^{\omega}(G)\) is used to describe bulk excitations of 3D Dijkgraaf-Witten models, and this center is equivalent to the twisted quantum double \(D^{\omega}(G)\) \cite[pg. 41]{arxiv:1905.08673}.
        TQD codewords are gauge-invariant boundary states of a 3D Dijkgraaf-Witten theory \cite[Sec. IX]{arxiv:1211.3695}.
    - code_id: string_net
      detail: 'String-net models reduce to TQDs for categories \(\text{Vec}^{\omega}G\), where \(G\) is a finite group, and \(\omega\) is a Type III cocycle. There is a duality between a large class of stringâ€“net models and certain TQD models \cite{arxiv:1211.3695}.'

    - code_id: spt
      detail: 'A TQD code Hamiltonian can be obtained from a 2D particular SPT model by promoting the model''s background gauge field to a dynamical gauge field. The same group and cocycle data classifies both 2D SPTs and TQDs \cite{arxiv:1202.3120,arxiv:1301.0861}.'

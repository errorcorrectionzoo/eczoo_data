name: 'Abelian TQD code'
introduced: '\cite{arxiv:1008.0654,arxiv:1211.3695}'

description: |
  TQD code whose codewords realize 2D modular gapped Abelian topological order.
  The corresponding anyon theory is defined by an Abelian group and a Type-III group cocycle that can be decomposed as a product of Type-I and Type-II group cocycles; see \cite[Sec. IV.A]{arxiv:2112.11394}.
  Abelian TQDs realize all modular gapped Abelian topological orders \cite{arxiv:2112.11394}.

  All Abelian TQD codes can be realized as modular-qudit lattice stabilizer codes by starting with an Abelian quantum double model along with a family of Abelian TQDs that generalize the double semion anyon theory and \hyperref[topic:code-switching]{condensing} certain bosonic anyons \cite{arxiv:2112.11394}. Abelian TQD codes need not be translationally invariant and can realize multiple topological phases on one lattice.
  Many Abelian TQD code Hamiltonians were originally formulated as commuting-projector models \cite{arxiv:1810.08204,arxiv:2001.11516}.

        Conversely, every Abelian anyon theory is a subtheory of some TQD \cite[Sec. 6.2]{arxiv:2211.03798}. 
        Any Abelian anyon theory \(A\) can be realized at one of the surfaces of a 3D Walker-Wang model whose underlying theory is an Abelian TQD containing \(A\) as a subtheory \cite{arxiv:1907.02075,arxiv:2202.05442}\cite[Appx. H]{arxiv:2211.03798}.

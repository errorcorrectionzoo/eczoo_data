name: 'Twisted quantum double (TQD) code'
short_name: 'TQD'
introduced: '\cite{doi:10.1016/0920-5632(91)90123-V,arxiv:1211.3695,arxiv:2107.13091}'

alternative_names:
  - '2D Dijkgraaf-Witten gauge theory code'

description: |
  Code whose codewords realize a 2D topological order rendered by a Chern-Simons topological field theory.
  The corresponding anyon theory is defined by a finite group \(G\) and a Type-III group cocycle \(\omega\), but can also be described in a category theoretic way \cite{arxiv:0705.0665}.
  Canonical TQD models \cite{arxiv:1211.3695} and other formulations whose ground states are in the same phase are all defined on group-valued qudits .

  Logical dimension is determined by the genus of the underlying surface (for closed surfaces), types of boundaries (for open surfaces), and any twist defects present.
  Excitations are described by the twisted quantum double (a.k.a. twisted Drinfield double) \(D^{\omega}(G)\).
  Gapped boundaries of the models are classified by a subgroup \(K \subseteq G\) and a particular two-cochain \cite{arxiv:1706.03611}.

protection: |
  These models realize local topological order (LTO) \cite{arxiv:2411.08675}.

  encoders:
    - 'For any solvable group \(G\), ground-state preparation can be done with an adaptive constant-depth circuit with geometrically local gates and measurements throughout \cite{arxiv:2209.06202}.'

      detail: |
        Restricting Dijkgraaf-Witten gauge theory to a 2D manifold reproduces the phase of the TQD model \cite{arxiv:0705.0665}.
        The Drinfield center of the category \(\text{Vec}^{\omega}(G)\) is used to describe bulk excitations of 3D Dijkgraaf-Witten models, and this center is equivalent to the twisted quantum double \(D^{\omega}(G)\) \cite[pg. 41]{arxiv:1905.08673}.
        TQD codewords are gauge-invariant boundary states of a 3D Dijkgraaf-Witten theory \cite[Sec. IX]{arxiv:1211.3695}.
    - code_id: string_net
      detail: 'String-net models realize TQDs for categories \(\text{Vec}^{\omega}G\), where \(G\) is a finite group, and \(\omega\) is a Type III cocycle. There is a duality between a large class of string–net models and certain TQD models \cite{arxiv:1211.3695}.'

name: 'Dihedral \(G=D_m\) quantum-double code'
introduced: '\cite{arXiv:quant-ph/9707021}'

description: |
  Quantum-double code whose codewords realize \(G=D_m\) topological order associated with a \(2m\)-element dihedral group \(D_m\).
  Includes the simplest non-Abelian order \(D_3 = S_3\) associated with the permutation group of three objects.

features:
  general_gates:
    - 'Universal topological quantum computation possible for certain groups such as \(G=D_3=S_3\) \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/0306063,arxiv:0901.1345}.'

realizations:
  - 'Signatures of a phase equivalent to the \(G=D_4\) quantum double detected in a 27-qubit trapped-ion device by Quantinuum \cite{arxiv:2305.03766}.
  Preparation of ground states and braiding of anyons has also been performed.
  The phase was realized as a gauged \(G=\mathbb{Z}_3^2\) twisted quantum double  \cite{arxiv:1508.03468}, which is the same topological order as the \(G=D_4\) quantum double \cite{arxiv:hep-th/9511195,arxiv:2112.12757}.'

notes:
  - 'See \cite[Sec. 5.4]{doi:10.1017/CBO9780511792908} for an introduction to this code.'
  - 'The \( \Phi, \Lambda \)  \href{https://citizensciencegames.com/games/decodoku/}{Decodoku game} is based on the quantum double model for the group \(D_3=S_3\) of permutations on three letters.'
  - 'Popular summary of realization of non-Abelian topological order in \href{https://www.quantamagazine.org/physicists-create-elusive-particles-that-remember-their-pasts-20230509/}{Quanta Magazine}.'

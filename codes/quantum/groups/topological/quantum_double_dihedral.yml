name: 'Dihedral \(G=D_m\) quantum-double code'
introduced: '\cite{arxiv:quant-ph/9707021,arxiv:1508.03468}'

description: |
  Quantum-double code whose codewords realize \(G=D_m\) topological order associated with a \(2m\)-element dihedral group \(D_m\).
  Includes the simplest non-Abelian order \(D_3 = S_3\) associated with the permutation group of three objects.
  The code can be realized as the ground-state subspace of the quantum double model, defined for \(D_m\)-valued qudits \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/9707021}.
  An alternative qubit-based formulation realizes the gauged \(G=\mathbb{Z}_3^2\) twisted quantum double phase \cite{arxiv:1508.03468}, which is the same topological order as the \(G=D_4\) quantum double \cite{arxiv:hep-th/9511195,arxiv:2112.12757}.

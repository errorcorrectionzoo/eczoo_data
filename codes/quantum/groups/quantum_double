name: 'Quantum-double code'
introduced: '\cite{arXiv:quant-ph/9707021}'

description: 'A family of topological codes, defined by a finite group \( G \),  whose generators are few-body operators associated to the stars and plaquettes, respectively, of a tessellation of a two-dimensional surface (with a qudit of dimension \( |G| \) located at each edge of the tesselation). The physical Hilbert space has dimension \( |G|^E  \) where \( E \) is the number of  edges in the tessellation. The dimension of the code space is the number of orbits of the conjugation action of \( G \) on \( Hom(\pi_1(\Sigma),G) \),  the set of group homomorphisms from the fundamental group of the surface \( \Sigma \) into the finite group \( G \) \cite{arXiv:quant-ph/1908.02829}. If we specialize to the case of \( G \) an abelian group then the formula for the dimension simplifies significantly to \( |G|^{2g} \) where \( g \) is the genus of the surface \( \Sigma \).

protection: 'The code distance is the number of edges in the shortest non contractible cycle in the tesselation or dual tesselation  \cite{arXiv:quant-ph/0110143}.'



notes:
  - 'The \( \Phi, \Lambda \)  \href{https://citizensciencegames.com/games/decodoku/}{Decodoku game} is based on the quantum double model for the group $ S_3 $ of permutations on three letters.'
  # Now sure where to place this; any ideas?
  - 'Alternative constructions encode information in the fusion space of the anyonic excitations of the quantum double model \cite{doi:10.1007/3-540-49208-9_31,arXiv:quant-ph/0306063,10.1017/CBO9780511792908}. The fusion space of non-Abelian anyons has dimension greater than one, allowing for topological quantum computation of logical information stored in the fusion outcomes.'

name: 'Group GKP codes'
introduced: '\cite{arXiv:1911.00099}'

description: 'Group code whose construction is based on nested subgroups \(H\subset K \subset G\). Logical subspace is spanned by basis states that are equal superpositions of elements of cosets of \(H\) in \(K\), and can be finite- or infinite-dimensional. Extension of the \hyperref[code:gkp]{GKP code} construction.'

protection: 'Protects against generalized bit-flip errors \(g\in G\) that are inside the fundamental domain of \(G/K\). Protection against phase-flip errors determined by branching rules of irreps of \(G\) into those of \(K\), and further into those of \(H\).'

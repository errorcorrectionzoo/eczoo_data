name: 'Quantum-double code'
introduced: '\cite{arXiv:quant-ph/9707021}'

description: |
  A family of topological codes, defined by a finite group \( G \),  whose generators are few-body operators associated to the stars and plaquettes, respectively, of a tessellation of a two-dimensional surface (with a qudit of dimension \( |G| \) located at each edge of the tesselation).

  The physical Hilbert space has dimension \( |G|^E  \), where \( E \) is the number of  edges in the tessellation. The dimension of the code space is the number of orbits of the conjugation action of \( G \) on \( \text{Hom}(\pi_1(\Sigma),G) \),  the set of group homomorphisms from the fundamental group of the surface \( \Sigma \) into the finite group \( G \) \cite{arXiv:1908.02829}. When \( G \) is abelian, the formula for the dimension simplifies to \( |G|^{2g} \), where \( g \) is the genus of the surface \( \Sigma \).

  The codespace is the ground-state subspace of the quantum double model Hamiltonian. For nonabelian groups, alternative constructions are possible, encoding information in the fusion space of the low-energy anyonic quasiparticle excitations of the model \cite{doi:10.1007/3-540-49208-9_31,arXiv:quant-ph/0306063,doi:10.1017/CBO9780511792908}. The fusion space of such nonabelian anyons has dimension greater than one, allowing for topological quantum computation of logical information stored in the fusion outcomes.

protection: 'Error-correcting properties established in Ref. \cite{arxiv:1908.02829}. The code distance is the number of edges in the shortest non contractible cycle in the tesselation or dual tesselation  \cite{arXiv:quant-ph/0110143}.'

  encoders:
    - 'For any solvable group \(G\), ground-state preparation and anyon-pair creation can be done with an adaptive constant-depth circuit with geometrically local gates and measurements throughout \cite{arXiv:2205.01933}. Anyon-pair creation requires an adaptive circuit for any nonabelian \(G\).'

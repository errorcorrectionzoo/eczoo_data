name: 'Group-based quantum code'

description: |
  Encodes a \textit{logical} Hilbert space, finite- or infinite-dimensional, into a \textit{physical} Hilbert space of \(L^2\)-normalizable functions on a second-countable unimodular group \(G\), i.e., a \(G\)\textit{-valued qudit} or \(G\)-qudit.
  In other words, a group-valued qudit is a vector space whose canonical basis states \(|g\rangle\) are labeled by elements \(g\) of a group \(G\).
  For \(K\)-dimensional logical subspace and for block codes defined on groups \(G^{n}\), can be denoted as \(((n,K))_G\).
  When the logical subspace is the Hilbert space of \(L^2\)-normalizable functions on \(G^{ k}\), can be denoted as \([[n,k]]_G\).
  Ideal codewords may not be normalizable, depending on whether \(G\) is continuous and/or noncompact, so approximate versions have to be constructed in practice.

  A notion of Gaussian states and Hudson's theorem have been developed for arbitrary locally compact Abelian \(G\) \cite{arxiv:2204.08162}.
  A Wigner function formalism has also been developed \cite{arxiv:2004.13860}.

  \subsection{Group-based error basis}
  A convenient error set is the group-based analogue of the Pauli string set for \hyperref[code:qubits_into_qubits]{qubit} codes.
  For a single group-valued qudit, this set consists of products of \(X\)-type operators labeled by group elements \(g\), and \(Z\)-type operators labeled by matrix elements of \(G\)-irreps \(\lambda\) \cite{arxiv:1408.6237,arxiv:1911.00099,arxiv:2111.12096}.
  The outline below is for finite groups, but can be extended to compact unimodular groups or to oscillators and rotors by substituting the sum over the group with a group integral.

  \begin{defterm}{Group-based error basis}
  \label{topic:group-pauli}
  There are two types of \(X\)-type operators, corresponding to left and right group multiplication.
  These act on computational basis states \(|h\rangle\) as
  \begin{align}
    \overrightarrow{X}_{g}|h\rangle&=|gh\rangle\\
    \overleftarrow{X}_{g}|h\rangle&=|hg^{-1}\rangle
  \end{align}
  for any group elements \(h,g\).
  The \(Z\)-type operators can be thought of as matrix-product operators (MPOs) \cite{arxiv:2312.09272} whose virtual dimension is the dimension \(d_{\lambda}\) of their corresponding irrep.
  The are diagonal in the group-valued basis, yielding the \(d_{\lambda}\)-dimensional irrep matrix \(Z_{\lambda}(g)\) evaluated at the given group element,
  \begin{align}
    \hat{Z}_{\lambda}\otimes|g\rangle=Z_{\lambda}(g)\otimes|g\rangle~.
  \end{align}
  Each matrix element of this irrep matrix is a generally non-unitary operator on the group-valued qudit.
  For one-dimensional irreps, the matrix reduces to a single unitary \(Z\)-type operator, and the direct-product symbol is no longer needed.
  For special cases of Abelian \(G\) being \(\mathbb{Z}_2\), \(\mathbb{Z}_q\), \(GF(q)\), \(U(1)\cong \mathbb{Z}\), or \(\mathbb{R}\), the group-based error basis reduces to the familiar \hyperref[topic:pauli]{qubit Pauli}, \hyperref[topic:qudit-pauli]{qubit Pauli}, \hyperref[topic:galois-pauli]{Galois-qudit Pauli}, \hyperref[topic:rotor-pauli]{rotor generalized Pauli}, or \hyperref[topic:displacements]{oscillator displacement} error basis, respectively.
  \end{defterm}

  Products of either left- or right-multiplication \(X\)-type operators with all \(Z\)-type operators form a basis for linear operators on the group-valued qudit space that is complete and orthonormal under the Hilbert-Schmidt inner product \cite[Eq. (123)]{arxiv:1911.00099}.
  In particular,
  \begin{align}
    \text{tr}(\overrightarrow{X}_{g}^{\dagger}\overrightarrow{X}_{h})=\delta_{g,h}^{G}~,
  \end{align}
  where the group Kronecker delta function \(\delta^{G}_{g,h}=1\) if \(g=h\) and zero otherwise.

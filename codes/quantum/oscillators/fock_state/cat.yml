name: 'Cat code'
introduced: '\cite{arXiv:quant-ph/9809037,arXiv:1207.0679}'

description: |
  Rotation-symmetric bosonic Fock-state code encoding a \(q\)-dimensional qudit into one oscillator. Codewords for a qubit code (\(q=2\)) consist of a coherent state \(|\alpha\rangle\) projected onto a subspace of Fock state number modulo \(2(S+1)\). The logical state \(|\overline{0}\rangle\) is in the \(\{|0\rangle , |2(S+1)\rangle , |4(S+1)\rangle \cdots \}\) Fock-state subspace, while \(|\overline{1}\rangle\) is in the \(\{|(S+1)\rangle, |3(S+1)\rangle , |5(S+1)\rangle , |7(S+1)\rangle \cdots \}\) subspace. An alternative basis, valid for for general \(q\) and \(\alpha\neq 0\), consists of \(q\) coherent states distributed equidistanctly around a circle in phase space of radius \(\alpha\).

protection: 'Due to the spacing between sets of Fock states, the distance between two distinct logical states is \(d=S+1\). Hence, this code is able to detect \(S\)-photon loss error. \textit{Two-legged cat codes} (\(S=0\)) do not protect against loss events, but there exist modifications based on sign alternation \cite{arXiv:1901.05358} or squeezing \cite{arXiv:2201.02570} that add such protection.'
#In addition, the codewords have \(Z_{S+1}\) rotational symmetry in phase space, and rotation errors up to angle \(\frac{\pi}{S+1}\) are correctable.'

    - 'Measurement in the Fock basis. For a \(2(S+1)\) cat code, a number measurement returns outcome \(2(S+1)k\), if \(k\) is even, then it corresponds to logical 0 state; if \(k\) is odd, then it corresponds to logical 1 state.'

realizations:
  - 'Two-legged (\(S=0\)) cat code has been realized in a superconducting circuit device by the Devoret group \cite{arXiv:1412.4633}. Exponential suppression of bit-flip errors achieved \cite{arXiv:1907.11729} up to a bit-flip time of 1 ms. A bit-flip time of up to 1 sec has been achieved while away from the logical-qubit regime \cite{arxiv:2204.09128}.'
  - 'Four-legged (\(S=1\)) cat code has been realized in a superconducting circuit device \cite{doi:10.1038/nature18949}. This paper is the first to reach break-even error-correction, where the lifetime of a logical qubit is on par with the lifetime of the noisiest constituent of the system.'

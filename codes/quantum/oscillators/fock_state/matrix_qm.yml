name: 'Matrix-model code'
introduced: '\cite{arxiv:2008.12869,arxiv:2211.08448}'

description: |
  Multimode-mode Fock-state bosonic approximate code derived from a matrix model, i.e., a non-Abelian bosonic gauge theory with a large gauge group.
  The model's degrees of freedom are matrix-valued bosons \(a\), each consisting of \(N^2\) harmonic oscillator modes and subject to an \(SU(N)\) gauge symmetry.

  A simple matrix-model code \cite{arxiv:2211.08448} consists of two spatially separated bosons with codewords
  \begin{align}
      |\mathcal{I}\rangle :=\prod_{(m,n)\in \mathcal{I} } \frac{\text{Tr}(a_1^{\dagger m}a_2^{\dagger n})}{N^{\frac{m+n}{2}}}|0\rangle_{12}~,
  \end{align}
  where \(\cal I\) is some set of integer two-tuples, and \(n,m\geq 0\).

  Gauge symmetry is assumed to be enforced in the above model.
  In other variants \cite{arxiv:2211.08448}, gauge symmetry is enforced energetically, requiring a parameter to scale as \(\log(N)\) for polynomial memory lifetime. This translates to the bath coupling being suppressed as \(1/N\).

protection: |
  For the spatially separated boson code, logical errors stemming from gauge-invariant physical errors are suppressed polynomially with the number of modes \(N\), as shown per the error-correction conditions.
  Memory time scales as \(N^2\) when the model is subject to a thermal bath.

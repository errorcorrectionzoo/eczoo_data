code_id: fock_state
physical: oscillators
logical: qudits

name: 'Fock-state bosonic code'
#introduced: '\cite{arxiv:quant-ph/9505011,arxiv:quant-ph/9610043}'

description: 'Qudit-into-oscillator code whose protection against \hyperref[topic:ad]{AD} noise (i.e., photon loss) stems from the use of disjoint sets of Fock states for the construction of each code basis state. The simplest example is the dual-rail code, which has codewords consisting of single Fock states \(|10\rangle\) and \(|01\rangle\). This code can detect a single loss error since a loss operator in either mode maps one of the codewords to a different Fock state \(|00\rangle\). More involved codewords consist of several well-separated Fock states such that multiple loss events can be detected and corrected.'

protection: 'Code distance \(d\) is the minimum distance (assuming some metric) between any two labels of Fock states corresponding to different code basis states. For a single mode, \(d\) is the minimum absolute value of the difference between any two Fock-state labels; such codes can detect up to \(d-1\) loss events. Multimode distances can be defined analogously; see, e.g., \hyperref[code:chuang-leung-yamamoto]{Chuang-Leung-Yamamoto codes}. There are tradeoffs in how well a Fock-state code protects against loss/gain errors and dephasing noise \cite{arxiv:2008.12576}.'

features:
  rate: 'There exists a family of Fock-state CE codes on \(q=N\) modes with logical dimension \(K = o(2^N)\) and distance of \hyperref[topic:asymptotics]{order} \(o(N/\log N)\) \cite{arxiv:2509.20545}.'

code_id: dual_rail
physical: qubits
logical: qubits

name: 'Dual-rail quantum code'
introduced: \cite{doi:10.1103/PhysRevA.52.3489}

description: 'Two-mode code encoding a logical qubit in Fock states with one excitation. The logical-zero state is represented by \(|01\rangle\),
while the logical-one state is represented by \(|10\rangle\).'

protection: |
  This is an error-detecting code against one photon loss event; it is often used in photonic quantum devices because of its ease of realization. A single loss event can be detected because, after the loss occurs, the output state \(|00\rangle\) is orthogonal to the codespace. Recovery is not possible, so a successful run of a quantum circuit is conditioned on not losing a photon during the circuit.

  For Deutsch''s  problem specifically, this code protects against errors resulting in states that have the correct photon number, but in the wrong modes \cite{doi:10.1103/PhysRevA.52.3489}.
#In general, this code can be used for universal QC in systems where amplitude damping is the primary noise source.

features:
  general_gates:
    - 'General gates are performed using beamsplitters and Kerr non-linearities.
    Universal quantum computing can be achieved with photons in dual-rail encodings using the
    KLM protocol \cite{doi:10.1038/35051009} with only linear optical elements and photon detectors.'

notes:
  - 'For Deutsch''s problem \cite{doi:10.1098/rspa.1992.0167} with optical qubits, error correction using photon number detection
  reduces the error probability from \(\frac{1}{4} (1+e^{-\gamma}-2e^{-3\gamma/2}) \)   to \(\frac{1}{2} (1- \text{sech} \gamma/2)\).'

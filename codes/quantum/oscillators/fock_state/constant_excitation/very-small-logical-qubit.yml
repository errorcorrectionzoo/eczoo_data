code_id: very-small-logical-qubit
physical: oscillators
logical: qubits

name: 'Very small logical qubit (VSLQ) code'
short_name: 'VSLQ'
introduced: '\cite{arxiv:1510.06117,arxiv:2302.06707}'

description: |
  The two logical codewords are \(|\pm\rangle \propto (|0\rangle\pm|2\rangle)(|0\rangle\pm|2\rangle)\), where the total Hilbert space is the tensor product of two transmon qudits (whose ground states \(|0\rangle\) and second excited states \(|2\rangle\) are used in the codewords).
  Since the code is intended to protect against losses, the qutrits can equivalently be thought of as oscillator Fock-state subspaces.

  In the original proposal for autonomous stabilization \cite{arxiv:1510.06117}, the single logical qubit is given by the two lowest energy states of a time-dependent Hamiltonian acting on two transmon qutrits and two lossy oscillators.

protection: 'Protects against a single \hyperref[topic:ad]{photon loss}.'

features:
  encoders:
    - 'Engineering a circuit made of two transmons and two oscillators coupled through three driven superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) results in passive stabilization of the logical states.'

  general_gates:
    - 'Single logical qubit operations implemented by resonant physical qubit driving and phase shifting the SQUID drives.'
    - 'A CZ gate between two logical qubits implemented by coupling devices through another driven SQUID and applying a pulse to the coupling squid simultaneously with a single qubit operation on one of the logical qubits.'

  decoders:
    - 'Logical qubit can be measured with physical qubit measurements along \(X\). Can be implemented by engineering a coupling of one of the qubits to a readout cavity via the interaction \(\sigma_x (a+a^\dagger)\) \cite{doi:10.1103/PhysRevLett.115.203601}. This results in an \(X\)-dependent shift of the readout cavity resonance which can be measured.'
    - 'Star-code autonomous correction scheme \cite{arxiv:2302.06707}.'

realizations:
  - 'Star-code autonomous correction scheme realized using superconducting circuits \cite{arxiv:2302.06707}.'

  cousins:

      detail: 'VSLQ decoder utilizes two ancillary oscillators.'
    - code_id: quantum_repetition
      detail: 'Parts of the VSLQ codewords resemble the two-qubit phase-flip repetition code, though the code cannot correct phase errors. Unlike the phase-flip code, the VSLQ code can correct for single \hyperref[topic:ad]{photon loss} because it uses the second excited state in the construction, which remains distinct from the vacuum even after \hyperref[topic:ad]{photon loss}.'

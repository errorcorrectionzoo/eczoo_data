code_id: 'dual_rail'
physical: 'oscillators'
logical: 'qubits'

name: 'Dual-rail quantum code'
introduced: '\cite{doi:10.1103/PhysRevA.52.3489}'

description: |
  Two-mode bosonic code encoding a logical qubit in Fock states with one excitation.
  The logical-zero state is represented by \(|10\rangle\), while the logical-one state is represented by \(|01\rangle\).
  This encoding is often realized in temporal or spatial modes, corresponding to a \textit{time-bin} or \textit{frequency-bin} encoding.
  Two different types of photon polarization can also be used.

protection: |
  This is an error-detecting code against one photon loss event; it is often used in photonic quantum devices because of its ease of realization. A single loss event can be detected because, after the loss occurs, the output state \(|00\rangle\) is orthogonal to the codespace. Recovery is not possible, so a successful run of a quantum circuit is conditioned on not losing a photon during the circuit.

  For Deutsch''s  problem specifically, this code protects against errors resulting in states that have the correct photon number, but in the wrong modes \cite{doi:10.1103/PhysRevA.52.3489}.

features:
  general_gates:
    - 'General gates are performed using beamsplitters \cite{doi:10.1038/s41467-023-41104-0} and Kerr nonlinearities.
    Universal quantum computing can be achieved using the KLM protocol \cite{doi:10.1038/35051009} with only linear optical elements and photon detectors.'
    - 'A probabilistic CZ gate via a non-linear sign-shift gate, which transforms the Fock states \( \alpha|0\rangle+\beta|1\rangle+\gamma|2\rangle\) into \(\alpha|0\rangle+\beta|1\rangle-\gamma|2\rangle \), followed by measurement \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/0307015}.'
    - 'Error-detecting \(CCZ\) and \(cSWAP\) gates using three-level ancilla \cite{arxiv:2212.11196}.'

  fault_tolerance:
    - 'Dual-rail qubits can be used to convert leakage and amplitude damping noise into erasure noise \cite{arxiv:2208.05461}.'

  threshold:
    - 'Between \(1.78\%\) and \(11.5\%\) with faulty photon detectors when repeatedly concatenating with the Steane code \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/0502101}.'

realizations:
  - 'The dual-rail code is ubiquitous in linear-optical quantum devices and is behind the KLM protocol, one of the first proposals for fault-tolerant computation.
  See reviews \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/0512104,arxiv:quant-ph/0512071} for more details.'
  - 'Superconducting circuit devices: Gates have been demonstrated in Rob Schoelkopf''s group at Yale University \cite{doi:10.1038/s41467-023-41104-0}. Error detection has been demonstrated in 3D cavities in Michel Devoret''s group at Yale University \cite{arxiv:2311.04423} and Amazon Web Services \cite{arxiv:2307.08737} using transmon qubits, following earlier theoretical proposals \cite{arxiv:2212.12077,arxiv:2208.05461}. Logical readout in 3D cavities has been demonstrated by Quantum Circuits Inc. \cite{arxiv:2307.03169}.'

notes:
  - 'For Deutsch''s problem \cite{doi:10.1098/rspa.1992.0167} with optical qubits, error correction using photon number detection reduces the error probability from \(\frac{1}{4} (1+e^{-\gamma}-2e^{-3\gamma/2}) \)   to \(\frac{1}{2} (1- \text{sech} \gamma/2)\).'

      detail: 'The KLM protocol, one of the first protocols for fault-tolerant quantum computation, utilizes concatenations of the dual-rail with a stabilizer code \cite{doi:10.1038/35051009}.
      Concatenating the dual-rail code with an \([[n,k,d]]\) stabilizer code yields an \([[2n,k,d]]\) constant-excitation code \cite{arxiv:2010.00538}.'
    - code_id: constant_excitation
      detail: 'An \(((8,1))\) constant-excitation code correcting a single amplitude damping error can be obtained from concatenating the \(\{|\overline{01}\rangle,|\overline{11}\rangle\}\) (constant-excitation) subcode with the dual-rail code.
      More generally, concatenating the dual-rail code with an \([[n,k,d]]\) stabilizer code yields an \([[2n,k,d]]\) constant-excitation code \cite{arxiv:2010.00538}.'

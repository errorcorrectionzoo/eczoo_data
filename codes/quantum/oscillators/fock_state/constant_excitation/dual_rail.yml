code_id: dual_rail
physical: oscillators
logical: qubits

name: 'Dual-rail quantum code'
introduced: \cite{doi:10.1103/PhysRevA.52.3489}

description: 'Two-mode code encoding a logical qubit in Fock states with one excitation. The logical-zero state is represented by \(|01\rangle\), while the logical-one state is represented by \(|10\rangle\). The two modes of the encoding can represent temporal or spatial modes, corresponding to a \textit{time-bin} or \textit{frequency-bin} encoding.'

protection: |
  This is an error-detecting code against one photon loss event; it is often used in photonic quantum devices because of its ease of realization. A single loss event can be detected because, after the loss occurs, the output state \(|00\rangle\) is orthogonal to the codespace. Recovery is not possible, so a successful run of a quantum circuit is conditioned on not losing a photon during the circuit.

  For Deutsch''s  problem specifically, this code protects against errors resulting in states that have the correct photon number, but in the wrong modes \cite{doi:10.1103/PhysRevA.52.3489}.
#In general, this code can be used for universal QC in systems where amplitude damping is the primary noise source.

features:
  general_gates:
    - 'General gates are performed using beamsplitters and Kerr non-linearities. Universal quantum computing can be achieved with photons in dual-rail encodings using the KLM protocol \cite{doi:10.1038/35051009} with only linear optical elements and photon detectors.'
    - 'Error-detecting \(CCZ\) and \(cSWAP\) gates using three-level ancilla \cite{arxiv:2212.11196}.'
  fault_tolerance:
    - 'Dual-rail qubits can be used to convert leakage and amplitude damping noise into erasure noise \cite{arxiv:2208.05461}.'

realizations:
  - 'The dual-rail code is ubiquitous in linear optical quantum devices \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/0512071}.'
  - 'Superconducting circuit devices: error detection has been demonstrated by Quantum Circuits Inc. \cite{arxiv:2307.03169} and Amazon Web Services \cite{arxiv:2307.08737}, following earlier theoretical proposals \cite{arxiv:2212.12077,arxiv:2208.05461}.'


notes:
  - 'For Deutsch''s problem \cite{doi:10.1098/rspa.1992.0167} with optical qubits, error correction using photon number detection reduces the error probability from \(\frac{1}{4} (1+e^{-\gamma}-2e^{-3\gamma/2}) \)   to \(\frac{1}{2} (1- \text{sech} \gamma/2)\).'
  - 'See review \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/0512071} for more details.'

code_id: chuang-leung-yamamoto
physical: oscillators
logical: qubits

name: 'Chuang-Leung-Yamamoto (CLY) code'
introduced: '\cite{doi:10.1103/PhysRevA.56.1114}'

description: |
  Bosonic Fock-state code that encodes \(k\) qubits into \(n\) oscillators, with each oscillator restricted to having at most \(N\) excitations. Codewords are superpositions of oscillator Fock states which have exactly \(N\) total excitations, and are either uniform (i.e., balanced) superpositions or unbalanced superpositions. Codes can be denoted as \([[N,n,2^k,d]]\), which conflicts with \hyperref[code:stabilizer]{stabilizer code} notation.

# A simple example of a CLY code is a two-mode "0-2-4" qubit code with codewords
# \begin{align}
# \begin{split}
#   |\overline{0}\rangle&=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(|40\rangle+|04\rangle\right)\\
#   |\overline{1}\rangle&=|22\rangle~.
# \end{split}
# \end{align}


protection: |
  Protects against amplitude damping for up to \(t = d-1\) excitation losses. Defining the \textit{spacing} between two Fock states \(|u_1\cdots u_n\rangle\) and \(|v_1\cdots v_n\rangle\),
  \begin{align}
  \text{Spacing}(u,v) = \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^n |u_i - v_i|,
  \end{align}
  the code distance \(d\) can be defined as the minimial spacing between Fock states making up the codewords.

features:
  rate: 'Code rate is \(\frac{k}{n \log_2(N+1)}\). To correct the loss of up to \(t\) excitations with \(K+1\) codewords, a code exists with scaling \(N \sim t^3 K/2\).'

  encoders:
    - 'Photon Fock state input into a network of beamsplitters, phase shifters, and Kerr media. These operations all preserve total photon number. Beamsplitters and phase shifters take annihilation operators to linear combinations of annihilation operators, and the transformation matrix is unitary. The operations corresponding to Kerr nonlinear media are diagonal in the Fock basis, but they implement phases that in general depend nonlinearly on the number of photons in each mode. State preparation may require ancillary modes and be conditioned on photon-number measurement results.'

name: 'Squeezed-vacuum code'
introduced: '\cite{arxiv:2504.01664,arxiv:2511.06108}'

alternative_names:
  - 'Multi-legged squeezed code'

description: |
  A squeezed Fock-state code constructed from a coherent superposition of \(m\) squeezed vacuum states, each squeezed along equiangular axes in phase space. 
  
  For an even integer \(m > 0\) (the number of ``legs'') and squeezing strength \(r\), the two logical codewords are defined as
  \begin{align}
    |0_L\rangle & \propto \sum_{j=0}^{m-1} S\left(r, \frac{\pi j}{m}\right) \ket{0}, \\
    |1_L\rangle & \propto \sum_{j=0}^{m-1} (-1)^{j} S\left(r, \frac{\pi j}{m}\right) \ket{0},
  \end{align}
  where \(S(r,\theta) \equiv S(r e^{i\phi(\theta)})\) is the squeezing operator with \(\phi(\theta) = 2\theta + \pi \pmod{2\pi}\), defined as
  \begin{equation}
  S(\zeta) = \exp\!\left[\frac{1}{2}\left(\zeta^{*} a^{2}-\zeta\, a^{\dagger 2}\right)\right],
  \end{equation}
  and where \(\zeta = r e^{i\phi}\) and \(r\) is the squeezing strength. 
  This operator elongates the vacuum state along direction \(\theta\) in phase space.

protection: |
  In Fock space, the logical states occupy photon numbers \(n \equiv 2k \pmod{2m}\) for \(k \in \{0, m/2\}\), yielding natural number distributions that are interleaved by \(\Delta n = m\). 
  The code distance against single-photon loss is \(d = m\), where \(m\) is the number of legs (squeezed vacuum states in superposition). 
  The code provides protection against both photon loss and dephasing noise, with a fundamental trade-off: increasing \(m\) improves loss tolerance at the cost of higher dephasing sensitivity.

      Probabilistic preparation for \(m=2\): 
      The simplest circuit uses a Hadamard-Controlled-Squeezing-Hadamard (\(H\)-\(CS\)-\(H\)) sequence on a single ancilla qubit coupled to a bosonic mode initially in vacuum. 
      The controlled squeezing gate is defined as
      \begin{equation}
      CS(r;\theta_0,\theta_1) = \ket{0}\!\bra{0}\otimes S(r,\theta_0) + \ket{1}\!\bra{1}\otimes S(r,\theta_1).
      \end{equation}
      After applying \(H\)-\(CS(r;0,\pi/2)\)-\(H\) and measuring the ancilla in the \(Z\) basis, the bosonic mode collapses to either \(\ket{0_L}\) or \(\ket{1_L}\) with probabilities
      \begin{equation}
      \text{prob}(L \mid r) = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{(-1)^L}{2 \cosh r \sqrt{\tanh^2 r + 1}},
      \end{equation}
      where \(L \in \{0, 1\}\). Post-selection on the measurement outcome yields the desired logical state.

      Deterministic preparation for general \(m\):
      For \(m > 2\), the codes can be prepared using sequences of conditional rotations \(CR(\theta)\) that rotate the bosonic mode in phase space by angle \(\theta\) conditioned on the qubit state, combined with logical-\(X\) gates that flip between the computational basis states. 
      The circuit involves creating superpositions with single-qubit gates and applying conditional operations in a recursive manner. 
      With full single-qubit control and controlled-squeezing operations, these circuits provide universal control over the joint qubit-oscillator system.
    - |
      Recursive construction:
      Higher-\(m\) codes can be generated by feeding back the output of lower-\(m\) code preparation circuits, applying additional conditional rotations, and selecting appropriate measurement outcomes. This allows systematic construction of the entire code family.

  general_gates:
    - 'Universal computation requires multiple bosonic modes and entangling gates between them, such as a controllable cross-Kerr interaction \(a^\dagger a \otimes a^\dagger a\) that enables generation of the entangling \(CZ\) gate.'

    - 'Logical operations within a single mode can be performed using Gaussian operations (displacement, rotation, squeezing) combined with conditional control from an ancilla qubit.'

  decoders:
    - 'The interleaved photon-number structure, \(n \equiv 2k \pmod{2m}\), enables photon-number-resolving measurements to identify single-photon loss events, which can then be corrected.'

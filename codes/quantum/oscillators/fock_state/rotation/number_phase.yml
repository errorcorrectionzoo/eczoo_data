description: |
  Bosonic rotation code consisting of superpositions of Pegg-Barnett phase states \cite{doi:10.1088/0305-4470/19/18/030},
  \begin{align}
  |\phi\rangle \equiv \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i} n \phi} \ket{n}.
  \end{align}
  Since phase states and thus the ideal codewords are not normalizable, approximate versions need to be constructed. The codes' key feature is that, in the ideal case, phase measurement has zero uncertainty, making it a good canditate for a syndrome measurement.

  Logical states of an order-\(N\) number-phase qubit encoding are \(|\overline{0}\rangle= \sum_{m=0}^{2N-1} |\phi = m\pi/N\rangle\) and \(|\overline{1}\rangle = \sum_{m=0}^{2N-1} (-1)^m |\phi=m\pi/N\rangle\). By performing the summation over \(m\), one finds that \(|\overline{0}\rangle\) is supported on Fock states \(|2kN\rangle\), while \(|\overline{1}\rangle\) is supported on states \(|(2k+1)N\rangle\), for \(k \geq 0\).

  Number-phase codes of order \(N\) detect up to \(N\) photon loss or gain errors, and dephasing up to \(\theta = \pi/N\).
  However, the code is only approximately error-correcting due to the non-orthogonality of Pegg-Barnett phase states \cite{doi:10.1088/0305-4470/19/18/030}, which act as the angular position states in the number-phase interpretation of the oscillator.

  decoders:
    - 'Modular phase measurement done in the logical \(X\), or dual, basis has zero uncertainty in the case of ideal number phase codes. This is equivalent to a quantum measurement of the spectrum of the Susskind–Glogower phase operator. Approximate number-phase codes are characterized by vanishing phase uncertainty. Such measurements can be utilized for Knill error correction (a.k.a. telecorrection \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/0601066}), which is based on teleportation \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/0410199,arXiv:quant-ph/0312190}. This type of error correction avoids the complicated correction procedures typical in Fock-state codes, but requires a supply of clean codewords \cite{arxiv:1901.08071}. Performance of this method was analyzed in Ref. \cite{arxiv:2108.01009}.'
    - 'Number measurement can be done by extracting modular number information using a CROT gate \(\mathrm{e}^{(2\pi \mathrm{i} / NM) \hat n \otimes \hat n}\) and performing phase measurements \cite{preset:Helstrom,doi:10.1007/978-88-7642-378-9} on an ancillary mode. See Section 4.B.1 of Ref. \cite{arxiv:1901.08071}.'

      detail: 'Number-phase codes are a manifestation of planar-rotor GKP codes in an oscillator. Both codes protect against small shifts in angular degrees of freedom.'
    - code_id: oscillator_stabilizer
      detail: 'Number-phase codewords span the joint right eigenspace of the \(N\)th power of the Susskind–Glogower phase operator and the bosonic rotation operator \cite{arxiv:1901.08071}. These operators no longer form a group since the phase operator is not unitary.'
    - code_id: gkp
      detail: 'Square-lattice GKP codes utilize translational symmetry in phase space, while number-phase codes utilize rotational symmetry. The two are related via a mapping \cite{arxiv:2206.01751}.'

logical: qudits

name: 'Binomial code'
introduced: '\cite{arXiv:1602.00008}'

description: |
  Bosonic rotation codes designed to approximately protect against errors consisting of powers of raising and lowering operators up to some maximum power. Binomial codes can be thought of as spin-coherent states embedded into an oscillator \cite{arXiv:1708.05010}.

  A simple example of a binomial code is the \textit{"0-2-4"} qubit code with codewords
  \begin{align}
  \begin{split}
    |\overline{0}\rangle&=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(|0\rangle+|4\rangle\right)\\
    |\overline{1}\rangle&=|2\rangle~,
  \end{split}
  \end{align}
  constructed out of binomial states \cite{doi:10.1080/713821735}.

  General \(q\)-dimensional qudit \((N, S)\) binomial codeword states are \(\{|\overline{i}\rangle\mid i\in \mathbb Z_q \}\), where
    \begin{align}
      |\overline{i}\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{q^N}} \sum_{\substack{p=0\\p\equiv i \pmod{q}}}^{(q-1)(N+1)} \sqrt{\binom{N+1}{p}_q} \ket{p(S+1)}.
    \end{align}
    The set \( \ket{i} \mid i \in \mathbb{N}\) is the set of Fock states. Also, \(\binom{N+1}{p}_q\) are extended binomial coefficients, or polynomial coeffiients, defined recursively as
    \begin{align}
      \binom{n}{m}_1 \equiv 1,\quad \binom{n}{m}_q \equiv \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k}\binom{k}{m-k}_{q-1}.
    \end{align}
    The extended binomial coefficients \( \binom{n}{m}_q \) are also the coefficients of \( x^m \) in the polynomial \( (1 + x + \cdots + x^{q-1})^n \).

protection: 'An \((N, S)\) binomial code protects against \(L\) boson losses, \(G\) boson gains, and dephasing up to \(\hat{n}^{D}\), where \(S=L+G\) and \(N = \mathrm{max}(L,G,2D)\).  Binomial codes approximately protect against continuous-time amplitude damping, boson loss and gain, and dephasing.'

features:
  general_gates:
    - 'Error-detecting \(CCZ\) and \(cSWAP\) gates for "0-2-4" code using three-level ancilla \cite{arxiv:2212.11196}.'

  decoders:
    - 'Photon loss and dephasing errors can be detected by measuring the phase-space rotation \(\exp\left(2\pi\mathrm{i} \hat{n} / (S+1)\right)\) and the check operator \(J_x/J\) in the spin-coherent state language, where \(J\) is the total angular momentum and \(J_x\) is the angular momentum in the \(x\) direction \cite{arXiv:1708.05010}. This type of error correction fails for errors that are products of photon loss/gain and dephasing errors. However, for certain \((N,S)\) instances of the binomial code, detection of these types of errors can be done.'
    - 'Recovery can be done via projective measurements and unitary operations \cite{arXiv:1602.00008,arXiv:1708.05010}.'

realizations:
  - 'Microwave cavities coupled to superconducting circuits: state transfer between a binomial codeword to another system \cite{arxiv:1712.05832}, error-correction protocol nearly reaching break-even \cite{arxiv:1805.09072}, and a teleported CNOT gate \cite{arxiv:1810.04690}. A realization of the "0-2-4" encoding is the first to go beyond break-even error-correction and yields a logical lifetime that exceeds the cavity lifetime by \(16\%\) \cite{arxiv:2211.09319} (see also \cite{arxiv:2211.09116}). See Ref. \cite{arxiv:2111.07965} for another experiment.'
  - 'Motional degree of freedom of a trapped ion: binomial state preparation for \(S=2\) realized by Tan group \cite{arxiv:2310.15546}.'

notes:
  - 'The mean occupation number, or average Fock-state number in maximally-mixed state of the code, is \((N+1)(S+1)(q-1)/2 \), where \(q\) is the qudit dimension.'

      detail: 'One can verify by direct calculation that the logical states are eigenstates of the discrete rotation operator. One has freedom in the exact form of the primitive state to choose; see Appendix B.2 of Ref. \cite{arxiv:1901.08071}.'

      detail: 'For a fixed \(S\), binomial codes with \(N \to \infty\) coincide with cat codes as \(\alpha \to \infty\) \cite{arXiv:1602.00008}.'
    - code_id: number_phase
      detail: 'In the limit as \(N,S \to \infty\), phase measurement in the binomial code has vanishing variance, just like in a number-phase code \cite{arxiv:1901.08071}.'

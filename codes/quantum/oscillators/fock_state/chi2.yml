physical: oscillators
logical: qudits

name: '\(\chi^{(2)}\) code'
introduced: '\cite{arXiv:1709.05302}'

description: |
  A \(3n\)-mode bosonic Fock-state code that requires only linear optics and the \(\chi^{(2)}\) optical nonlinear interaction for encoding, decoding, and logical gates.
  Codewords lie in Fock-state subspaces that are invariant under Hermitian combinations of the \(\chi^{(2)}\) nonlinearities \(abc^\dagger\) and \(i abc^\dagger\), where \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are lowering operators acting on one of the \(n\) triples of modes on which the codes are defined.
  Codewords are also \(+1\) eigenstates of stabilizer-like \textit{symmetry operators}, and photon parities are error syndromes.

protection: 'Codes protect against loss, gain, and dephasing errors conditional on the knowledge of the total number of photons lost.'

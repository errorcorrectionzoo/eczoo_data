introduced: '\(|\alpha\rangle \pm |-\alpha\rangle\) cat code \cite{doi:10.1103/PhysRevA.59.2631}'


description: 'It is a continuous-variable code that encode a logical qubit into a harmonic oscillator. In phase space, cat code has rotation symmtry which can protect against dephasing noise. The state preparation process is to project a coherent state \(|\alpha\rangle\) with large \(\alpha\) onto a subspace of occupation number modulo \(2(S+1)\). Hence, the logical state \(|0\rangle_L\) is in the \(\{|0\rangle , |2(S+1)\rangle , |4(S+1)\rangle ...\}\) subspace; the \(|1\rangle_L\) is in the \(\{|3(S+1)\rangle , |5(S+1)\rangle , |7(S+1)\rangle ...\}\). Due to the separation between two logical subspace, the distance between two distinct logical states is \(d=S+1\). Hence, this code is able to detect \(S\)-photon loss error. In addition, the codewords have \(Z_{S+1}\) rotational symmetry in phase space.'

protection: 'Protect against multi-photon loss, gain error and phase space rotation error up to \(d=\frac{\pi}{S+1}\).'

  - '\(S=1\) cat state has been realized in superconducting circuit \cite{doi:10.1038/nature18949}. This paper is the first break-even point of quantum error-correction, where the lifetime of a logical qubit exceeds the lifetime of the constituents of the systems. The logical qubit lifetime is 320 microseconds, which is 20 times longer than the lifetime of the transmon.'

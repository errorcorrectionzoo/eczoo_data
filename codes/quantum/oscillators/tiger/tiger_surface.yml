name: 'Tiger surface code'
introduced: '\cite{arxiv:2411.09668}'

description: |
  A tiger-code variant of the Kitaev surface code that is constructed from a hypergraph product of two repetition codes over the integers.
  The code is conjectured to realize phases of \(U(1)\) gauge theory. 

protection: |
  Both loss and Euclidean distances scale as the square root of the number of modes for particular rectangular geometries.
  The Euclidean distance goes to zero for the case of a square lattice.

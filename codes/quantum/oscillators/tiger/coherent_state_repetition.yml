code_id: coherent_state_repetition
physical: oscillators
logical: qubits

name: 'Coherent-state repetition code'
introduced: '\cite{arxiv:quant-ph/0109077,arxiv:quant-ph/0306004}'

description: |
  A concatenated qubit-into-\(n\)-mode code (for odd \(n\)) whose outer code is a quantum repetition code and whose inner code is the two-component cat code in its coherent-state basis. 
  
  A basis of codewords is
  \begin{align}
    |\overline{\pm}\rangle\propto\left|\pm\alpha\right\rangle ^{\otimes n}
  \end{align}
  for \(|\alpha| > 0\).

protection: |
  The code cannot protect against losses and has a minimum Euclidean distance \(d_Z = 4n\) \cite{arxiv:2411.09668}.


features:
  encoders:
    - 'Lindbladian-based dissipative encoding with dissipators \(\hat{a}_j \hat{a}_k - \alpha^2\) for neighboring modes \(j,k\) on a 1D line as well as local dissipators \(\hat{a}_j^2 - \alpha^2\). Encoding passively protects against cavity dephasing.'

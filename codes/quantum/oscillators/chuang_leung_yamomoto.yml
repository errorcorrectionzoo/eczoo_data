      detail: 'This is a fock state code which protects against amplitude damping'
  cousins:
    - code_id: dual_rail
      detail: 'The dual rail code is a precursor to Chuang-Leung-Yamomoto codes for amplitude damping,
      and can be considered as a special case. However, when photon loss occurs in a dual rail
      encoding, information is irrecoverably lost, while the more general Chuang-Leung-Yamomoto
      codes allow for recovery.'

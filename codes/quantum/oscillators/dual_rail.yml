physical: qubits
logical: qubits

name: 'Dual Rail'

introduced: \cite{doi:10.1103/PhysRevA.52.3489}

description: 'In a dual rail qubit encoding, single qubits are represented by Fock states
in 2 modes. The logical \(\ket{0}\) state is represented by \(\ket{01}\),
while the logical \(\ket{1}\) state is represented by \(\ket{10}\).'

protection: 'This is an error detecting code against loss.
It protects against amplitude damping due to a Caldeira-Leggett type coupling (dissipation with a quantum particle coupled to a bath)
between the mode and the environment, with coupling constant \( \gamma \). When
photon loss occurs, the output state does not agree with any of the possible correct
outcomes, as it has a different photon number. Further, for Deutsch''s  problem specifically,
this code protects against errors resulting in states that have the correct photon number, but
in the wrong modes. \cite{doi:10.1103/PhysRevA.52.3489}. In general, this code can be used for universal QC
in systems where amplitude damping
is the primary noise source.'

features:
  general_gates:
    - 'General gates are performed using beamsplitters and Kerr non-linearities.
    Universal quantum computing can be achieved with photons in dual rail encodings using the
    KLM protocol with only linear optical elements and photon detectors.'

notes:
  - 'For Deutsch''s problem with optical qubits, error correction using photon number detection
  reduces the error probability from \(\frac{1}{4} (1+e^{-\gamma}-2e^{-3\gamma/2}) \)
  to \(\frac{1}{2} (1- sech \gamma/2)\)'
  - '. However, this encoding only allows for error correction by means
  of repeating executions when photon loss is detected, and does not allow for recovery.'

    - code_id: chuang_leung_yamamoto
      detail: 'This code is a precursor to Chuang-Leung-Yamomoto codes for amplitude damping,
      and can be considered as a special case. However, when photon loss occurs in a dual rail
      encoding, information is irrecoverably lost, while the more general Chuang-Leung-Yamomoto
      codes allow for recovery.'

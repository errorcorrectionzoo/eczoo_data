physical: oscillators

name: 'Bosonic stabilizer code'

description: |
  Bosonic code whose codespace is defined as the common \(+1\) eigenspace of a group of mutually commuting \textit{displacement operators} (exponentials of linear combinations of position and momentum operators). Such displacement-based codes closely resemble and inherit some features of qubit stabilizer codes. Displlacements, and therefore the stabilizers, have continuous eigenvalues, in contrast with the discrete set of eigenvalues of a qubit stabilizer code. Exact codewords are non-normalizable, so approximate constructions have to be considered.

  Stabilizer codewords encoding a finite-dimensional codespace admit a discrete infinite stabilizer group. Qubit-into-oscillator stabilizer codes are equivalent to \hyperref[code:gkp]{GKP codes}.

  Stabilizer codewords encoding a logical oscillator admit either a discrete or a continuous stabilizer group. The former, called GKP-stabilizer codes, are obtained from multimode GKP codes by removing stabilizer generators for some of the modes. The latter are most easily defined in terms of the group's Lie algebra, i.e., as the common \(0\)-eigenvalue eigenspace of mutually commuting linear combinations of oscillator position and momentum operators called \textit{annihilators}. An \(((n,k,d))_{\mathbb{R}}\) \hyperref[code:oscillators_into_oscillators]{oscillator-into-oscillator} stabilizer code is denoted as \([[n,k,d]]_{\mathbb{R}}\), where \(d\) is the code's distance.

  A bosonic stabilizer code admitting a set of mutually commuting operators (either annihilators or displacements) such that each operator consists of either position or momentum operators is called a \textit{bosonic CSS code}.

protection: 'Protective properties can be delineated in terms of the annihilators or displacements. If an error operator does not commute with a stabilizer group element, then that error is detectable. Oscillator-into-oscillator stabilizer codes protect against erasures of a subset of modes, while GKP codes protect against sufficiently small displacements in any number of modes.'

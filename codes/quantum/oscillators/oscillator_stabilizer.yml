code_id: oscillator_stabilizer
physical: oscillators

name: 'Bosonic stabilizer code'

description: |
  Bosonic code whose codespace is defined as the common \(+1\) eigenspace of a group of mutually commuting \textit{displacement operators} (exponentials of linear combinations of position and momentum operators). Such displacement-based codes closely resemble and inherit some features of qubit stabilizer codes.

  Stabilizer codewords encoding a logical oscillator admit a continuous stabilizer group, and can thus be defined in terms of the group's Lie algebra, i.e., as the common \(0\)-eigenvalue eigenspace of mutually commuting linear combinations of oscillator position and momentum operators called \textit{annihilators}. An \(((n,k,d))_{\mathbb{R}}\) \hyperref[code:oscillators_into_oscillators]{oscillator-into-oscillator} stabilizer code is denoted as \([[n,k,d]]_{\mathbb{R}}\), where \(d\) is the code's distance.

  Stabilizer codewords encoding a finite-dimensional codespace admit a discrete infinite stabilizer group. Qubit-into-oscillator stabilizer codes are equivalent to \hyperref[code:gkp]{GKP codes}.

  A bosonic stabilizer code admitting a set of mutually commuting operators (either annihilators or displacements) such that each operator consists of either position or momentum operators is called a \textit{bosonic CSS code}.

protection: 'Protective properties can be delineated in terms of the annihilators or displacements. If an error operator does not commute with a stabilizer group element, then that error is detectable. Oscillator-into-oscillator stabilizer codes protect against erasures of a subset of modes, while GKP codes protect against sufficiently small displacements in any number of modes.'

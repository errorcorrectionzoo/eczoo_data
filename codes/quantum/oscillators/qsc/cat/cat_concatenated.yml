code_id: cat_concatenated
physical: oscillators

name: 'Concatenated cat code'
introduced: '\cite{arxiv:1409.6759}'

description: |
  A concatenated code whose outer code is a cat code. In other words, a qubit code that can be thought of as a concatenation of an arbitrary inner code and another cat outer code. Most examples encode physical qubits of an inner stabilizer code into the two-component cat code in its cat-state basis.

protection: |
  The cat code suppresses dephasing errors exponentially with the size of its coherent states, so the inner code (e.g., a quantum repetition code \cite{arxiv:1904.09474,arxiv:1905.00450,arxiv:2009.10756,arxiv:2212.11927}) can be highly biased toward one type of noise while still ensuring good performance.

      detail: 'Stabilizers of CSS codes concatenated with two-component cat codes in their coherent-state basis come directly from the CSS codes via the mapping \(X \to (-1)^{\hat n}\) and \(Z \to \hat a\) \cite{arxiv:2302.11593}. Stabilizers of CSS codes concatenated with two-component cat codes in their cat-state basis come directly from the CSS codes via the mapping \(Z \to (-1)^{\hat n}\) and \(X \to \hat a\). In both cases, one type of noise is handled actively via syndrome extraction and correction, while the other type is handled passively via stabilizing dissipation.'

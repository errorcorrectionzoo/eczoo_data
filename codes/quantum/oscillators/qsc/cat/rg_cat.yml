code_id: rg_cat
physical: oscillators
logical: qubits

name: 'Renormalization group (RG) cat code'
short_name: 'RG cat'
introduced: '\cite{arxiv:2012.14001,arxiv:2112.05099,arxiv:2401.17795}'

description: |
  Code whose codespace is spanned by \(q\) field-theoretic coherent states which are flowing under the renormalization group (RG) flow of massive free fields. The code approximately protects against displacements that represent local (i.e., short-distance, ultraviolet, or UV) operators. Intuitively, this is because RG cat codewords represent non-local (i.e., long-distance) degrees of freedom, which should only be excitable by acting on a macroscopically large number of short-distance degrees of freedom.

protection: |
  Approximately protects against displacements that represent ultraviolet coherent operators, i.e., short-distance degrees of freedom of the field theory.

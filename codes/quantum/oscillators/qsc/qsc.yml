description: |
  Code whose codewords are superpositions of points on an \(n\)-dimensional real or complex sphere.
  Such codes can in principle be defined on any configuration space housing a sphere, but the focus of this entry is on QSCs constructed out of coherent-state constellations.

  More technically, a QSC is a collection \(\{\mathcal{C}_k\}_{k=1}^K\) of \textit{logical constellations}, each of which yields a codeword by taking a quantum superposition of all points \(\mathbf{x}\in \mathcal{C}_k\).
  Taken together, the logical constellations yield the \textit{code constellation}, \(\mathcal{C}=\bigcup_{k=1}^{K}\mathcal{C}_{k}\).

  Codewords of coherent-state QSCs of uniform superposition are defined as
  \begin{align}
    |\mathcal{C}_{k}\rangle\sim\frac{1}{\sqrt{|{\mathcal{C}}_{k}|}}\sum_{\boldsymbol{\alpha}\in\mathcal{C}_{k}}|\sqrt{\bar{N}}\boldsymbol{\alpha}\rangle~,
  \end{align}
  where \( |\boldsymbol{\alpha} \rangle = |\alpha_1,\alpha_2,...\alpha_n \rangle \) is an \(n\)-mode coherent state.
  This asymptotic expression is valid in the limit of large energy \(\bar{N}\to\infty\).

  Coherent-state QSCs on \(n\) modes are denoted by
  \(((n,K,d_E,\langle t_{\downarrow},d_{\updownarrow},d_{\downarrow}\rangle))\),
  where \(K\) is codespace dimension, \(d_E\) is the \textit{squared minimum distance}, i.e., the smallest Euclidean distance between pairs of distinct points across all codewords, and \( t_{\downarrow},d_{\updownarrow},d_{\downarrow} \) are the number of \textit{correctable} losses (plus 1), the degree distance, and the number of \textit{detectable} losses (plus 1), respectively.

  The \textit{resolution} \(d_E\) of the code is defined as
    \begin{align}
      d_E = \min_{\boldsymbol{\alpha},\boldsymbol{\beta}\in\mathcal{C}} \Vert\boldsymbol{\alpha}-\boldsymbol{\beta}\Vert^2~.
    \end{align}
  The code protects against passive Gaussian transformations, which manifest as rotations on the sphere, \( |\boldsymbol{\alpha}\rangle \rightarrow |\mathbf{R}\boldsymbol{\alpha}\rangle \) for all \(\mathbf{R}\).
  Detectable transformations corresponds to rotations for which
    \begin{align}
      \Vert \mathbf{R}\boldsymbol{\alpha} - \boldsymbol{\alpha}\Vert^2 < d_E~,
    \end{align}
  in the large \(\bar{N}\) limit.

  The code also protects against general ladder errors, which are defined as
  \begin{align}
    E_{\mathbf{p},\mathbf{q}}(\mathbf{a}^{\dagger},\mathbf{a})=\prod_{j=1}^{n}a_{j}^{\dagger p_{j}}a_{j}^{q_{j}}~.
  \end{align}
  Any \hyperref[topic:ad]{AD} ladder error \(E_{\mathbf{p}=\boldsymbol{0},\mathbf{q}}\) with \(|\mathbf{q}|<d_{\downarrow}\) is detectable.
  Any ladder error \(E_{\mathbf{p},\mathbf{q}}\) with \(|\mathbf{p}|,|\mathbf{q}|<t_{\downarrow}\) is detectable, implying that up to \(t_{\downarrow}-1\) losses are correctable.
  Any ladder error with degree \(|\mathbf{p}+\mathbf{q}|<d_{\updownarrow}\) is detectable.

physical: oscillators
logical: qudits

name: 'Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) code'
short_name: 'GKP'
introduced: '\cite{doi:10.1103/PhysRevA.64.012310}'

description: 'Bosonic qudit-into-oscillator code whose stabilizers are oscillator displacement operators \(\hat{S}_q(2\alpha)=e^{-2i\alpha \hat{p}}\) and \(\hat{S}_p(2\beta)=e^{2i\beta \hat{q}}\). To ensure \(\hat{S}_q(2\alpha)\) and \(\hat{S}_p(2\beta)\) generate a stabilizer group that is Abelian, there is another constraint that \(\alpha\beta=2k\pi\) where \(k\) is an integer. Codewords can be expressed as equal weight superpositions of coherent states on an infinite lattice, such as a square lattice in phase space with spatial period \(2\sqrt{\pi}\). The exact GKP state is non-normalizable, so approximate constructs have to be considered.'

protection: 'For stabilizer \(\hat{S}_q(2\alpha),\hat{S}_p(2\beta)\), code can correct displacement errors up to \(\frac{\alpha}{2}\) in the \(q\)-direction and \(\frac{\beta}{2}\) at \(p\)-direction. Approximately protects against photon loss errors \cite{doi:10.1103/PhysRevA.93.012315}, outperforming most other codes designed to explicitly protect against loss \cite{arxiv:1708.05010}. Very sensitive to dephasing errors \cite{doi:10.1103/PRXQuantum.2.020101}. A biased-noise GKP error correcting code can be prepared by choosing \(\alpha\neq \beta\).'

features:

  encoders:
    - 'Preparation of approximate GKP states is studied both theoretically and experimentally on circuit-QED platforms, by putting the GKP lattice inside a Gaussian envelope \cite{doi:10.1103/PhysRevA.93.012315}, \cite{doi:10.1103/PhysRevA.97.022341}, \cite{doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2603-3}.'

  transversal_gates: 'Clifford gates can be realized by performing linear optics operations, sympletic transformations and displacements \cite{doi:10.1103/PhysRevA.64.012310}, all of which are Gaussian operations. Pauli gates can be performed using displacement operators.'

  general_gates:
    - 'By applying GKP error correction to Gaussian input states, universality can be achieved without non-Gaussian elements \cite{doi:10.1103/PhysRevLett.123.200502}.'

  decoders:
    - 'Syndrome measruement of displacement error can be done by applying a controlled-displacement controlled by an ancilla qubit. The syndrome information can be obtained by measuring the ancilla qubit after controlled-displacement opearation. See Section. 2D in \cite{doi:10.1103/PRXQuantum.2.020101}.'
    - 'Pauli \(X\),\(Y\) and \(Z\) measurements can be performed by measuring \(-\hat{p},\hat{q}-\hat{p}\) and \(\hat{q}\) repectively. If the measurement outcome is closed to an even multiple of \(\sqrt{\pi}\), then the outcome is +1. If the measurement outcome is closed to an odd multiple of \(\sqrt{\pi}\), then the outcome is -1. See Section. 2D in \cite{doi:10.1103/PRXQuantum.2.020101}.'

realizations:
  - 'Approximate GKP code is realized on a superconducting microwave cavity \cite{doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2603-3} and a trapped-ion oscillator \cite{doi:10.1038/s41586-019-0960-6}.'

      #detail: 'It is a concatenation that replace the physical qubits in toric code by GKP codes. Each physical qubit is replaced by a harmonic oscillator in GKP state \cite{doi:10.1103/PhysRevA.99.032344}. By using the GKP error information, the toric code threshold is improved from \(10%\) to \(14%\).'

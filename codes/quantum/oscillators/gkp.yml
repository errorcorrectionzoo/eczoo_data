description: 'It is a continuous-variable code that encode a logical qubit into a harmonic oscillator. Its stabilizer is displacement operators \(\hat{S}_q(2\alpha)=e^{-2i\alpha \hat{p}}\) and \(\hat{S}_p(2\beta)=e^{2i\beta \hat{q}}\). To ensure \(\hat{S}_q(2\alpha)\) and \(\hat{S}_p(2\beta)\) generate a stabilizer group which is Abelian, there is another constraint that \(\alpha\beta=2k\pi\) where \(k\) is an integer. Its codewords are equal weight superpositions of coherent states. When \(\alpha=\beta=\sqrt{\pi}\), \(|0_L\rangle=\sum_{j=-\infty}^\infty |2j\sqrt{\pi}\rangle_q\), \(|1_L\rangle=\sum_{j=-\infty}^\infty(2j+1)\sqrt{\pi}\rangle_q\). The codewords form a square lattice in phase space with spatial period \(2\sqrt{\pi}\).'

features:

  # The fields below relate to specific properties of the code that are worth
  # noting. In some cases (see below), there might be multiple pieces of
  # information associated with a field (e.g., mutliple encoders/decoders,
  # multiple facts about fault tolerance, etc.); in such cases, the field
  # accepts a list of text entries, with one item per piece of information.

  # Any fields below should be omitted if they do not apply.

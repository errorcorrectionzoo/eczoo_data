physical: oscillators
logical: qudits

name: 'Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) code'
short_name: 'GKP'
introduced: '\cite{arXiv:quant-ph/0008040}'

description: 'Bosonic qudit-into-oscillator code whose stabilizers are oscillator displacement operators \(\hat{S}_q(2\alpha)=e^{-2i\alpha \hat{p}}\) and \(\hat{S}_p(2\beta)=e^{2i\beta \hat{q}}\). To ensure \(\hat{S}_q(2\alpha)\) and \(\hat{S}_p(2\beta)\) generate a stabilizer group that is Abelian, there is another constraint that \(\alpha\beta=2k\pi\) where \(k\) is an integer. Codewords can be expressed as equal weight superpositions of coherent states on an infinite lattice, such as a square lattice in phase space with spatial period \(2\sqrt{\pi}\). The exact GKP state is non-normalizable, so approximate constructs have to be considered.'

protection: 'For stabilizer \(\hat{S}_q(2\alpha),\hat{S}_p(2\beta)\), code can correct displacement errors up to \(\frac{\alpha}{2}\) in the \(q\)-direction and \(\frac{\beta}{2}\) at \(p\)-direction. Approximately protects against photon loss errors \cite{doi:10.1103/PhysRevA.93.012315}, outperforming most other codes designed to explicitly protect against loss \cite{arxiv:1708.05010}. Very sensitive to dephasing errors \cite{doi:10.1103/PRXQuantum.2.020101}. A biased-noise GKP error correcting code can be prepared by choosing \(\alpha\neq \beta\).'

features:

  encoders:
    - 'Preparation of approximate GKP states is studied both theoretically and experimentally on circuit-QED platforms, by putting the GKP lattice inside a Gaussian envelope \cite{doi:10.1103/PhysRevA.93.012315,doi:10.1103/PhysRevA.97.022341,doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2603-3}.'

  general_gates:
    - 'By applying GKP error correction to Gaussian input states, universality can be achieved without non-Gaussian elements \cite{doi:10.1103/PhysRevLett.123.200502}.'

  fault_tolerance:
    - 'Clifford gates can be realized by performing linear-optical operations, sympletic transformations and displacements, all of which are Gaussian operations. Pauli gates can be performed using displacement operators. Clifford gates are fault tolerant in the sense that they map bounded-size errors to bounded-size errors \cite{arXiv:quant-ph/0008040}.' #for the qubit square-lattice GKP code performed by occupation-number-preserving Gaussian operations
    - 'Error correction scheme is fault-tolerant to displacement noise as long as all input states have displacement errors less than \(\sqrt{\pi}/6\) \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/0510107}.'

  decoders:
    - 'Syndrome measruement of displacement error can be done by applying a controlled-displacement controlled by an ancilla qubit. The syndrome information can be obtained by measuring the ancilla qubit after controlled-displacement opearation. See Section. 2D in \cite{doi:10.1103/PRXQuantum.2.020101}.'
    - 'Pauli \(X\),\(Y\) and \(Z\) measurements can be performed by measuring \(-\hat{p},\hat{q}-\hat{p}\) and \(\hat{q}\) repectively. If the measurement outcome is closed to an even multiple of \(\sqrt{\pi}\), then the outcome is +1. If the measurement outcome is closed to an odd multiple of \(\sqrt{\pi}\), then the outcome is -1. See Section. 2D in \cite{doi:10.1103/PRXQuantum.2.020101}.'

notes:
  - 'GKP codes were obtained after iterative numerical optimization of encoding and recovery against photon loss, starting with Haar-random states \cite{arXiv:1801.07271}.'

realizations:
  - 'Microwave cavity coupled to superconducting circuits \cite{doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2603-3}.'
  - 'Motional degree of freedom in a trapped ion \cite{doi:10.1038/s41586-019-0960-6}.'

    #- code_id: toric_GKP
      #detail: 'It is a concatenation that replace the physical qubits in toric code by GKP codes. Each physical qubit is replaced by a harmonic oscillator in GKP state \cite{doi:10.1103/PhysRevA.99.032344}. By using the GKP error information, the toric code threshold is improved from \(10%\) to \(14%\).'

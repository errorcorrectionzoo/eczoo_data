code_id: gkp
physical: oscillators
logical: qudits

name: 'Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) code'


introduced: '\cite{doi:10.1103/PhysRevA.64.012310}'


description: 'It is a continuous-variable code that encode a logical qubit into a harmonic oscillator. Its stabilizer is displacement operators \(\hat{S}_q(2\alpha)=e^{-2i\alpha \hat{p}}\) and \(\hat{S}_p(2\beta)=e^{2i\beta \hat{q}}\). To ensure \(\hat{S}_q(2\alpha)\) and \(\hat{S}_p(2\beta)\) generate a stabilizer group which is Abelian, there is another constraint that \(\alpha\beta=2k\pi\) where \(k\) is an integer. Its codewords are equal weight superpositions of coherent states. The codewords form a square lattice in phase space with spatial period \(2\sqrt{\pi}\). The exact GKP state cannot be prepared.'

protection: 'For stabilizer \(\hat{S}_q(2\alpha),\hat{S}_p(2\beta)\), it can correct displacement error up to \(\frac{\alpha}{2}\) at \(q\)-direction and \(\frac{\beta}{2}\) at \(p\)-direction. It can also protect against photon loss errors \cite{arxiv:1708.05010}, but very sensitive to dephasing errors \cite{doi:10.1103/PRXQuantum.2.020101}.  The biased GKP error correcting code can be prepared by choosing \(\alpha\neq \beta\).'

    - 'Preparation of approximate GKP states is studied both theoretically and experimentally on circuit-QED platforms, by putting the GKP lattice inside a Guassian envelope \cite{doi:10.1103/PhysRevA.93.012315}, \cite{doi:10.1103/PhysRevA.97.022341}, \cite{doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2603-3}.'

  general_gates:
    - 'Pauli gates'
    - 'Clifford gates can be realized by performing linear optics operations, sympletic transformations and displacements \cite{doi:10.1103/PhysRevA.64.012310}. All of them are Gaussian operations. '
    - 'By applying GKP error correction to Gaussian input states, the universality is achieved without extra non-Gaussian elements \cite{doi:10.1103/PhysRevLett.123.200502}.'

  decoders:
    - 'Syndrome measruement of displacement error can be done by applying a controlled-displacement controlled by an ancilla qubit. The syndrome information can be obtained by measuring the ancilla qubit after controlled-displacement opearation. See Section. 2D in \cite{doi:10.1103/PRXQuantum.2.020101}.'
    - 'Pauli \(X\),\(Y\) and \(Z\) measurements can be performed by measuring \(-\hat{p},\hat{q}-\hat{p}\) and \(\hat{q}\) repectively. If the measurement outcome is closed to an even multiple of \(\sqrt{\pi}\), then the outcome is +1. If the measurement outcome is closed to an odd multiple of \(\sqrt{\pi}\), then the outcome is -1. See Section. 2D in \cite{doi:10.1103/PRXQuantum.2.020101}.'

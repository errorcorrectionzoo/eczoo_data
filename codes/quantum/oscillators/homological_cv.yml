code_id: homological_cv
physical: oscillators
logical: oscillators

name: 'Homological bosonic code'
introduced: '\cite{arXiv:1601.02544}'

description: |
  An \([[n,1]]_{\mathbb{R}}\) \hyperref[code:oscillator_stabilizer]{oscillator-into-oscillator CSS stabilizer code} defined using homological structres associated with an \(n-1\) simplex. Relevant to the study of spacetime replication of quantum information \cite{arxiv:1210.0913}.

  Stabilizer generators are defined by two orthogonal subspaces of the \(C_1\) in the chain complex. \(C_X = \partial_2 C_2\) and \(C_P = \partial_1^T Q\) for some \(Q \subset C_0\). The standard approach would use \(Q = C_0\), which would mean the logical dimension would be the dimension of the 1st homology group \(H^1\). However, \(H^1\) is trivial for the \(n-1\) simplex, so one chooses \(Q \neq C_0\) such that exactly one stabilizer is removed, yielding a stabilizer code instead of a single stabilized state.'

protection: 'Protects against certain types of erasure errors (depending on the specific dimension). Certain constructions also protect arbitrary sized errors on multiple photon states.'

features:

  encoders:
    - 'Encoding depends on the specific dimension, but can generally be done using generalized conditional-rotation and Fourier-transform gates.'

  decoders:
    - 'Decoding requires a different circuit for each possible erasure error, with no general circuit decoding any possible erasure error. Every circuit relies on a generalized conditional rotation, which Ref. \cite{arXiv:1601.02544} calls the \textit{QND Gate} and which is defined as \(QND_c | x , y \rangle = |x + c y, y \rangle\).'

realizations:
  - 'No experimental realization. However, Ref. \cite{arXiv:1601.02544} describes a potential experimental optical procedure for the simplest non-trival code with 5 modes.'

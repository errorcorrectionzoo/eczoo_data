description: |
  An oscillator-into-oscillator stabilizer code encoding \(k\) logical modes into \(n\) physical modes. An \(((n,k,d))_{\mathbb{R}}\) analog stabilizer code is denoted as \([[n,k,d]]_{\mathbb{R}}\), where \(d\) is the code's distance.
  Any analog stabilizer state can be thought of as a pure Gaussian state that has been infinitely squeezed on all modes \cite{arxiv:2503.15698}.

  Analog stabilizer codes admit continuous stabilizer group of displacements.  This group can equivalently be defined in terms of its Lie algebra. The codespace is equivalently the common \(0\)-eigenvalue eigenspace of the Lie algebra generators, which are mutually commuting linear combinations of oscillator position and momentum operators called \textit{nullifiers} \cite{arxiv:0903.3233} or \textit{annihilators}.
  An analog stabilizer code admitting a set of nullifiers such that each nullifier consists of either position or momentum operators is called an \textit{analog CSS code}.

protection: |
  Protects against erasures of or any errors on at most \(d-1\) modes. 
  If an error operator does not commute with a nullifier, then that error is detectable. 
  There are conditions on the encoding circuit which guarantee that the code can correct errors \cite{doi:10.1103/PhysRevA.81.062305}.
  The code can be further optimized to increase resolution between syndrome spaces for certain noise \cite{doi:10.1103/PhysRevA.81.062305}.

  Protection of logical modes against small displacements or other errors acting in every physical mode cannot be done using only Gaussian resources \cite{arxiv:0811.3128,arxiv:1810.00047} (see also \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/0204052,arxiv:quant-ph/0204085}). 
  There are no such restrictions for non-Gaussian noise \cite{arxiv:0811.3616,doi:10.1103/PhysRevA.81.062305}.

    - code_id: gkp-stabilizer
      detail: 'Analog stabilizer codes protect logical modes against arbitrarily large displacements on a few modes, while oscillator-into-oscillator GKP codes protect a finite-dimensional logical space against sufficiently small displacements in any number of modes. Encoding in analog-stabilizer (oscillator-into-oscillator GKP) codes can be done by a Gaussian operation acting on a tensor product of an arbitrary state in the first mode and position states (GKP states) on the remaining modes.
      Protection of logical modes against small displacements cannot be done using only Gaussian resources \cite{arxiv:1810.00047,arxiv:quant-ph/0204052,arxiv:0811.3128}, so oscillator-into-oscillator GKP codes can be thought of as analog stabilizer encodings utilizing non-Gaussian GKP resource states.'

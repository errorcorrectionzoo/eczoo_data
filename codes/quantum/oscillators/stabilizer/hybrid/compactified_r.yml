name: 'Compactified \(\mathbb{R}\) gauge theory code'
introduced: '\cite{arxiv:2411.04993}'

description: |
  An integer-homology bosonic CSS code realizing 2D \(U(1)\) gauge theory on bosonic modes.
  The code can be obtained from the analog surface code by \hyperref[topic:code-switching]{condensing} certain anyons \cite{arxiv:2411.04993}. 
  This results in a pinning of each mode to the space of periodic functions, which make up a physical rotor, and can be thought of as compactification of the 2D \(\mathbb{R}\) gauge theory phase realized by the analog surface code.

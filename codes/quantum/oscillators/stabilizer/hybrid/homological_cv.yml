# Can encode qubits or "rotors"

name: 'Integer-homology bosonic CSS code'
introduced: '\cite{arxiv:2411.04993}'

description: |
  A bosonic stabilizer code whose physical modes have been restricted, via a single GKP stabilizer, from the space of functions on the real line to the space of periodic functions.
  This restriction effectively realizes a rotor on each physical mode, allowing one to construct homological rotor codes out of displacement stabilizer groups.
  The stabilizer group is continuous, but contains discrete components in the form of the single-mode GKP stabilizers.
  The homology group of the logical operators has a torsion component because the chain complexes are defined over the ring of integers, which yields codes with finite logical dimension.

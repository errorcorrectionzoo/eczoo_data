name: 'Square-lattice GKP code'
introduced: '\cite{arxiv:quant-ph/0008040}'

description: |
  Single-mode GKP qudit-into-oscillator CSS code based on the rectangular lattice.
  Its stabilizer generators are oscillator displacement operators \(\hat{S}_q(2\alpha)=e^{-2i\alpha \hat{p}}\) and \(\hat{S}_p(2\beta)=e^{2i\beta \hat{x}}\).
  To ensure \(\hat{S}_q(2\alpha)\) and \(\hat{S}_p(2\beta)\) generate a stabilizer group that is Abelian, there is a constraint that \(\alpha\beta=2q\pi\) where \(q\) is an integer denoting the logical dimension.

  Codewords can be expressed as equal weight superpositions of coherent states on a rectangular lattice in phase space with spatial period \(2\sqrt{\pi}\).
  The exact GKP state is non-normalizable, so approximate constructions have to be considered.

  The \(q=1\) trivial encoding is spanned by the \textit{canonical GKP state} (a.k.a. \textit{grid state} or qunaught state \cite{arxiv:2008.12791}),
  \begin{align}
    |GKP\rangle=\sum_{\ell\in\mathbb{Z}}|x=\ell\sqrt{2\pi}\rangle~,
  \end{align}
  where \(|x\rangle\) are single-mode position states.

  Single-mode GKP states have been introduced in quantum foundations research defining modular conjugate variables \cite{doi:10.1007/BF00670008} and in coherent-state theory associated with the Heisenberg-Weyl group \cite{doi:10.1515/9781400889921,manual:{Cartier, Pierre. "Quantum mechanical commutation relations and theta functions." Proc. Sympos. Pure Math. Vol. 9. 1966.}}\cite{doi:10.1007/BF01077648}\cite[Sec. 1.5 and 3.2]{doi:10.1007/978-3-642-61629-7}.
  The Dirac-delta orthonormal and complete \cite{doi:10.1103/PhysRevB.12.1118} basis formed by the GKP canonical states and their error states is known as the \textit{Zak basis}, discovered indepenently by Gelfand \cite{manual:{Gelfand, I. M. “Expansion in characteristic functions of an equation with periodic coefficients”. In: Doklady Akad. Nauk SSSR (N.S.) 73 (1950), pp. 1117–1120.}} and Zak \cite{doi:10.1103/PhysRevLett.19.1385}.
  It is also called the Gelfand mapping, Weil-Brezin transform, and \(kq\) representation in condensed-matter physics and signal processing \cite{doi:10.1007/BF02391012}\cite[Ch. 1]{doi:10.1007/978-1-4612-2016-9}\cite[Eq. (1.112)]{doi:10.1515/9781400882427} (see Refs. \cite{manual:{Janssen, A. J. E. M. (1988). The Zak transform: a signal transform for sampled time-continuous signals. Philips Journal of Research, 43(1), 23-69.},doi:10.1109/18.179336} for more history). 
  Expansion of a function on \(\mathbb{R}\) in terms of this basis is called the \textit{Zak transform}. 
  The Segal-Bargmann representations of GKP states are the theta functions of the lowest Landau level on a torus \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/0008040}\cite[Sec. V]{arXiv:2002.07718}\cite[Prop. 6.3]{arxiv:2106.11093} (see also Refs. \cite{doi:10.1103/PhysRevB.31.2529,doi:10.1007/978-0-8176-4577-9}).

protection: 'For stabilizer \(\hat{S}_q(2\alpha),\hat{S}_p(2\beta)\), code can correct displacement errors up to \(\alpha/2\) in the \(q\)-direction and \(\beta/2\) at \(p\)-direction. Approximately protects against \hyperref[topic:ad]{photon loss} errors \cite{arxiv:1506.05033,arxiv:1708.05010}, outperforming most other codes designed to explicitly protect against loss \cite{arxiv:1708.05010}. An analytical expression can be derived for the effective logical channel after loss \cite{arxiv:2504.13497}. Very sensitive to dephasing errors \cite{arxiv:2106.12989}. A biased-noise GKP error correcting code can be prepared by choosing \(\alpha\neq \beta\). Expectation values of observables versus energy may be fittable to a power law \cite{arxiv:2512.03583}.'

Subsequent paper by Devoret group \cite{arxiv:2211.09116} uses reinforcement learning for error-correction cycle design and is the first to go beyond break-even error-correction, with the lifetime of a logical qubit exceeding the cavity lifetime by about a factor of two (see also \cite{arxiv:2211.09319}). See Ref. \cite{arxiv:2111.07965} for another experiment. A feed-forward-free, i.e., fully autonomous protocol has also been implemented by Nord Quantique \cite{arxiv:2310.11400}.

name: 'Square-lattice GKP code'
introduced: '\cite{arxiv:quant-ph/0008040}'

description: |
  Single-mode GKP qudit-into-oscillator code based on the rectangular lattice.
  Its stabilizer generators are oscillator displacement operators \(\hat{S}_q(2\alpha)=e^{-2i\alpha \hat{p}}\) and \(\hat{S}_p(2\beta)=e^{2i\beta \hat{x}}\).
  To ensure \(\hat{S}_q(2\alpha)\) and \(\hat{S}_p(2\beta)\) generate a stabilizer group that is Abelian, there is a constraint that \(\alpha\beta=2q\pi\) where \(q\) is an integer denoting the logical dimension.

  Codewords can be expressed as equal weight superpositions of coherent states on a rectangular lattice in phase space with spatial period \(2\sqrt{\pi}\).
  The exact GKP state is non-normalizable, so approximate constructs have to be considered.

  The \(q=1\) trivial encoding is spanned by the \textit{canonical GKP state} or \textit{grid state},
  \begin{align}
    |GKP\rangle=\sum_{n\in\mathbb{Z}}|x=n\sqrt{2\pi}\rangle~,
  \end{align}
  where \(|x\rangle\) are single-mode position states.

protection: 'For stabilizer \(\hat{S}_q(2\alpha),\hat{S}_p(2\beta)\), code can correct displacement errors up to \(\alpha/2\) in the \(q\)-direction and \(\beta/2\) at \(p\)-direction. Approximately protects against photon loss errors \cite{arxiv:1506.05033,arxiv:1708.05010}, outperforming most other codes designed to explicitly protect against loss \cite{arxiv:1708.05010}. Very sensitive to dephasing errors \cite{arxiv:2106.12989}. A biased-noise GKP error correcting code can be prepared by choosing \(\alpha\neq \beta\).'

Preparation of approximate square-lattice GKP states has been studied both theoretically and experimentally \cite{arxiv:1506.05033,arxiv:1709.08580,doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2603-3,arxiv:1910.03673}. Various damped versions of GKP states are equivalent \cite{arxiv:1910.08301,arxiv:2012.12488}, and there exists a Fock-state expansion \cite[Appx. A]{arxiv:2002.11008}.'

  general_gates:
    - 'By applying square-lattice GKP error correction to Gaussian input states, universality can be achieved without non-Gaussian elements \cite{arxiv:1903.00012}.'

  fault_tolerance:
    - 'Clifford gates can be realized by performing linear-optical operations, sympletic transformations and displacements, all of which are Gaussian operations. Pauli gates can be performed using displacement operators. Clifford gates are fault tolerant in the sense that they map bounded-size errors to bounded-size errors \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/0008040}.' #for the qubit square-lattice GKP code performed by occupation-number-preserving Gaussian operations

  decoders:
    - 'Syndrome measurement can be done by applying a controlled-displacement controlled by an ancilla qubit. The syndrome information can be obtained by measuring the ancilla qubit after controlled-displacement opearation. See Section. 2D in \cite{arxiv:2106.12989}.'

realizations:
  - 'Motional degree of freedom of a trapped ion: square-lattice GKP encoding realized with the help of post-selection by Home group \cite{arxiv:1807.01033,arxiv:1907.06478}, followed by realization of reduced form of GKP error correction, where displacement error syndromes are measured to one bit of precision using an ion electronic state \cite{arxiv:2010.09681}. State preparation also realized by Tan group \cite{arxiv:2310.15546}. Universal gate set, including a two-qubit entangling gate, realized by Tan group \cite{arxiv:2409.05455}. State initialization and application to measuring displacements \cite{arxiv:2412.04865}.'
  - 'Microwave cavity coupled to superconducting circuits: reduced form of square-lattice GKP error correction, where displacement error syndromes are measured to one bit of precision using an ancillary transmon \cite{arxiv:1907.12487}. Subsequent paper by Devoret group \cite{arxiv:2211.09116} uses reinforcement learning for error-correction cycle design and is the first to go beyond break-even error-correction, with the lifetime of a logical qubit exceeding the cavity lifetime by about a factor of two (see also \cite{arxiv:2211.09319}). See Ref. \cite{arxiv:2111.07965} for another experiment. A feed-forward-free, i.e., fully autonomous protocol has also been implemented by Nord Quantique \cite{arxiv:2310.11400}. Qudit encodings with \(q=3,4\) have been realized, with logical error rates also beyond break even \cite{arxiv:2409.15065}.'
  - 'GKP states and homodyne measurements have been realized in propagating telecom light by the Furusawa group \cite{arxiv:2309.02306}.'
  - 'Single-qubit \(Z\)-gate has been demonstrated \cite{arxiv:1904.01351} in the single-photon subspace of an infinite-mode space \cite{arxiv:2310.12618}, in which time and frequency become bosonic conjugate variables of a single effective bosonic mode. In this context, GKP position-state wavefunctions are called Dirac combs or frequency combs.'

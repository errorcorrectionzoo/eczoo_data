name: 'Square-lattice GKP code'
introduced: '\cite{arXiv:quant-ph/0008040}'

description: |
  Single-mode GKP qudit-into-oscillator code based on the rectangular lattice.
  Its stabilizer generators are oscillator displacement operators \(\hat{S}_q(2\alpha)=e^{-2i\alpha \hat{p}}\) and \(\hat{S}_p(2\beta)=e^{2i\beta \hat{x}}\).
  To ensure \(\hat{S}_q(2\alpha)\) and \(\hat{S}_p(2\beta)\) generate a stabilizer group that is Abelian, there is a constraint that \(\alpha\beta=2q\pi\) where \(q\) is an integer denoting the logical dimension.

  Codewords can be expressed as equal weight superpositions of coherent states on a rectangular lattice in phase space with spatial period \(2\sqrt{\pi}\).
  The exact GKP state is non-normalizable, so approximate constructs have to be considered.

  The \(q=1\) trivial encoding is spanned by the \textit{canonical GKP state} or \textit{grid state},
  \begin{align}
    |GKP\rangle=\sum_{n\in\mathbb{Z}}|x=n\sqrt{2\pi}\rangle~,
  \end{align}
  where \(|x\rangle\) are single-mode position states.

protection: 'For stabilizer \(\hat{S}_q(2\alpha),\hat{S}_p(2\beta)\), code can correct displacement errors up to \(\alpha/2\) in the \(q\)-direction and \(\beta/2\) at \(p\)-direction. Approximately protects against photon loss errors \cite{arxiv:1506.05033,arxiv:1708.05010}, outperforming most other codes designed to explicitly protect against loss \cite{arxiv:1708.05010}. Very sensitive to dephasing errors \cite{arxiv:2106.12989}. A biased-noise GKP error correcting code can be prepared by choosing \(\alpha\neq \beta\).'

  fault_tolerance:
    - 'Clifford gates can be realized by performing linear-optical operations, sympletic transformations and displacements, all of which are Gaussian operations. Pauli gates can be performed using displacement operators. Clifford gates are fault tolerant in the sense that they map bounded-size errors to bounded-size errors \cite{arXiv:quant-ph/0008040}.' #for the qubit square-lattice GKP code performed by occupation-number-preserving Gaussian operations
    - 'Error correction scheme is fault-tolerant to displacement noise as long as all input states have displacement errors less than \(\sqrt{\pi}/6\) \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/0510107}.'

  decoders:
    - 'Syndrome measurement can be done by applying a controlled-displacement controlled by an ancilla qubit. The syndrome information can be obtained by measuring the ancilla qubit after controlled-displacement opearation. See Section. 2D in \cite{arxiv:2106.12989}.'

    - 'Pauli \(X\),\(Y\) and \(Z\) measurements can be performed by measuring \(-\hat{p},\hat{x}-\hat{p}\) and \(\hat{x}\) repectively. If the measurement outcome is closed to an even multiple of \(\sqrt{\pi}\), then the outcome is +1. If the measurement outcome is closed to an odd multiple of \(\sqrt{\pi}\), then the outcome is -1. See Section. 2D in \cite{arxiv:2106.12989}.'

  - 'Motional degree of freedom of a trapped ion: square-lattice GKP encoding realized with the help of post-selection \cite{arxiv:1807.01033,arXiv:1907.06478}, followed by realization of reduced form of GKP error correction, where displacement error syndromes are measured to one bit of precision using an ion electronic state \cite{arxiv:2010.09681}.'
  - 'Microwave cavity coupled to superconducting circuits: reduced form of square-lattice GKP error correction, where displacement error syndromes are measured to one bit of precision using an ancillary transmon \cite{arxiv:1907.12487}. Subsequent paper \cite{arxiv:2211.09116} uses reinforcement learning for error-correction cycle design and is the first to go beyond break-even error-correction, with the lifetime of a logical qubit exceeding the cavity lifetime by about a factor of two (see also \cite{arxiv:2211.09319}).'
  - 'Single-qubit \(Z\)-gate has been demonstrated in the single-photon subspace of an infinite-mode space \cite{arxiv:1904.01351}, in which time and frequency become bosonic conjugate variables of a single effective bosonic mode.'
  - 'In signal processing, GKP state position-state wavefunctions are related to Dirac combs \cite{doi:10.1007/978-1-4612-2016-9}.'

name: 'Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) code'
short_name: 'GKP'
introduced: '\cite{arxiv:quant-ph/0008040,arxiv:quant-ph/0105058}'

description: |
  Quantum lattice code for a non-degenerate lattice, thereby admitting a finite-dimensional logical subspace.
  Codes on \(n\) modes can be constructed from lattices with \(2n\)-dimensional full-rank Gram matrices \(A\).

  The centralizer for the stabilizer group within the displacement operators case can be identified with the symplectic dual lattice \({\mathcal{L}}^{\perp}\) (i.e. all points in \(\mathbb{R}^{2n}\) that have integer symplectic inner product with all points in \({\mathcal{L}}\) ), such that logical operations are identified with the dual quotients \({\mathcal{L}}^{\perp}/{\mathcal{L}}\). The size of this dual quotient is the determinant of the Gram matrix, yielding the logical dimension \(d=\sqrt{\| \det{A}\|}\) \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/0008040}.
  Stabilizer generator matrices equivalent under symplectic transformations are classified by distinct Hermite normal forms \cite{arxiv:2109.14645}.

  The space of all single-mode GKP codes is the moduli space of elliptic curves, i.e., the three sphere with a trefoil knot removed \cite{arXiv:2407.03270}.

protection: 'The level of protection against displacement errors is quantified by the Euclidean code distance \(\Delta=\min_{x\in {\mathcal{L}}^{\perp}\setminus {\mathcal{L}}} \|x\|_2\) \cite{arxiv:2109.14645}.'

features:
  rate: |
    Transmission schemes with multimode GKP codes achieve a lower bound on displacement noise and a lower bound on the thermal-noise Gaussian channel capacities \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/0105058,arxiv:1708.07257,arxiv:1801.04731,arxiv:1801.07271}. 
    Particular random lattice families of multimode GKP codes achieve the hashing bound of the displacement noise channel \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/0105058}.
    Particular families of GKP codes achieve the capacity of \hyperref[topic:ad]{AD} and amplifications channels \cite{arxiv:2412.06715}.

  encoders:
    - 'GKP codes with fixed \(n\) and prime-dimensional logical Hilbert space are symplectically related to a disjoint product of single-mode GKP codes on \(n\) modes, such that encoding via Gaussian unitaries is possible.'
    - 'Dissipative stabilization of finite-energy GKP states using stabilizers conjugated by \textit{cooling} (\cite{arxiv:1310.7596}, Appx. B) or \textit{damping} operator, i.e., a damped exponential of the total occupation number \cite{arxiv:2009.07941,arxiv:2201.12337}.'

  general_gates:
    - 'Gaussian operations and homodyne measurements on GKP states are classically simulable, and there is a sufficient condition for an additional element to achieve universal quantum computation \cite{arxiv:2309.07820}.'
    - 'There is a relation between magic (i.e., how far away a state is from being a stabilizer state) and non-Gaussianity for GKP codewords \cite{arxiv:2109.13018,arxiv:2406.06418}. In particular, implementing a non-Clifford logical gate requires a higher degree of non-Gaussianity than that expressed by ideal non-normalizable GKP states \cite{arxiv:2406.06418}.'
    - 'By applying GKP error correction to Gaussian input states, computational universality can be achieved without additional non-Gaussian elements  \cite{arxiv:1903.00012}. This procedure can be alternatively desscribed as performing heterodyne detection on one half of a GKP encoded Bell pair.'
    - 'Logical shadow tomography protocol \cite{arxiv:2411.00235}.'

  fault_tolerance:
    - 'Logical Clifford operations are given by Gaussian unitaries, which map bounded-size errors to bounded-size errors \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/0008040}.
    For single-mode GKP codes, these operations correspond to non-trivial loops in the space of all single-mode GKP codes (the moduli space of elliptic curves, i.e., the three sphere with a trefoil knot removed) \cite{arXiv:2407.03270}.
    Such gates provide another example of monodromy under the particular notion of parallel transport introduced in Ref. \cite{arxiv:1309.7062}.'

  decoders:
    - 'The MLD decoder for Gaussian displacement errors is realized by evaluating a lattice theta function, and in general the decision can be approximated by either solving (approximating) the closest vector problem (CVP) \cite{doi:10.1109/TIT.2002.800499} (a.k.a. closest lattice point problem) or by using other effective iterative schemes when, e.g., the lattice represents a concatenated GKP code \cite{arxiv:1810.00047,arxiv:1908.03579,arxiv:2109.14645,arxiv:2111.07029}. While the decoder time scales exponentially with number of modes \(n\) generically, the time can be polynomial in \(n\) for certain codes \cite{arxiv:2303.04702}.'
    - 'Babai''s nearest plane algorithm \cite{doi:10.1007/bf02579403} can be used for bounded-distance decoding \cite{arxiv:2303.04702}.'
    - 'Combining \hyperref[topic:ad]{AD} noise with amplification yields displacement noise, the noise that GKP codes are designed to correct \cite{arxiv:1801.07271}.'
    - 'ML decoder for correcting shift errors in GKP two-qubit gates \cite{arxiv:2103.06994}.'

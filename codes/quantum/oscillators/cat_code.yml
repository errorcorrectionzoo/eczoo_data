description: 'It is a continuous-variable code that encode a logical qubit into a harmonic oscillator. In phase space, cat code has rotation symmtry which can protect against dephasing noise. '

protection: 'Protect against multi-photon loss, gain error and phase space rotation error up to \(\frac{\pi}{S+1}\).'

features:

  # The fields below relate to specific properties of the code that are worth
  # noting. In some cases (see below), there might be multiple pieces of
  # information associated with a field (e.g., mutliple encoders/decoders,
  # multiple facts about fault tolerance, etc.); in such cases, the field
  # accepts a list of text entries, with one item per piece of information.
  #
  # Any fields below should be omitted if they do not apply.

  rate: 'Encode a 2-dimensional logical Hilbert space into an infinite dimensional Hilbert space. A cat code with \(Z_{2(S+1)}\) rotation symmetry can protect against \(S\)-photon loss/gain errors and phase space rotation error up to \(\frac{\pi}{2(S+1)}\).'

  decoders:
    - 'Measurement in the Fock basis. For a \(2(S+1)\) cat code, a number measurement returns outcome \(2(S+1)k\), if \(k\) is even, then it corresponds to logical 0 state; if \(k\) is odd, then it corresponds to logical 1 state.'

realizations:
  # List and explain the different "domains" of realizations in list items.
  # Group closely related realizations into a single item. It's OK to have a
  # single list item. Each item should more or less correspond to what would be

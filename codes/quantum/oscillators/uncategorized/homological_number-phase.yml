code_id: homological_number-phase
physical: oscillators

name: 'Homological number-phase code'
introduced: '\cite{arxiv:2311.07679}'

description: |
  A \hyperref[code:homological_rotor]{homological \(n\)-rotor code} mapped into the Fock-state space of \(n\) oscillators by identifying non-negative rotor angular-momentum states with  oscillator Fock states.
  The resulting oscillator code can encode logical rotors or qudits due to the presence of torsion in the chain complex defining the original rotor code.

  Due to the absence of negative Fock states, a given homological rotor code first has to be rotated such that it has non-trivial support in the all-positive momentum orthant.
  This can be done by flipping the signs of the angular momenta of some of the rotors \cite[Prop. 1]{arxiv:2311.07679}.
  Ideal codewords are not normalizable, and approximate versions have to be constructed.

  Since the original homological rotor codes are using an extension of the \hyperref[topic:CSS-to-homology-correspondence]{qubit CSS-to-homology correspondence} to rotors, the mapping into oscillators makes such homological encodings possible for the oscillator.

protection: |
  The homology group of the logical operators has a torsion component because the chain complexes are defined over the ring of integers, which yields codes with finite logical dimension.
  Products of chain complexes can also yield rotor codes.

  The distances of the original homological rotor code are preserved, although the resulting number-phase code is approximately error-correcting due to the non-orthogonality of Pegg-Barnett phase states \cite{doi:10.1088/0305-4470/19/18/030}, which act as the angular position states in the number-phase interpretation of the oscillator.

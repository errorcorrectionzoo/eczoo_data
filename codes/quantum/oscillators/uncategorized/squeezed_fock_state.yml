code_id: squeezed_fock_state
physical: oscillators
logical: qudits

name: 'Squeezed fock-state code'
introduced: '\cite{arxiv:2312.16000,arxiv:2506.00300}'

description: |
  Approximate bosonic code that encodes a qubit into the same Fock state, but one which is squeezed in opposite directions.
  More general versions include superpositions of squeezed Fock states that are the result of a photon-number resolving measurement \cite{arxiv:2509.16993}.

  Taking the Fock state \(|1\rangle\), the codewords are
  \begin{align}
  \begin{split}
  |\overline{0}\rangle&=S(r)|1\rangle \\
  |\overline{1}\rangle&=S(-r)|1\rangle~,
  \end{split}
  \end{align}
  where \(S(\pm r)\) is the squeezing operator with squeezing parameter \(\pm r\).

protection: 'The code approximately protects against loss and dephasing errors, becoming exact in the \(r\to\infty\) limit.'

code_id: wasilewski-banaszek
physical: oscillators
logical: qubits

name: 'Wasilewski-Banaszek'

# First reference with the code (optional).
introduced: '\cite{doi:10.1103/PhysRevA.75.042316}'

description: 'Three-photon code for a single qubit. \(|0_L\rangle = (|003\rangle+|030\rangle+|300\rangle)/\sqrt{3},\qquad|1_L\rangle = |111\rangle \).'

protection: 'Protects against photon loss'

features:

  # Any fields below should be omitted if they do not apply.

  #rate: 'k/n, usually listed for a family of codes, but can be notable for a single one. Discussed alongside other parameters such as check operator weight, distance, etc.'

  # This field that starts a list of strings, indexed by a dash; do not leave it
  # empty. If empty, comment out.
  encoders: 
    - 'Qubit encoded in dual rail representation can be transferred to this code by input qubit modes into a linear optical network with four other modes all with one photon input. Successful encoding is conditioned on measurement of the state \(|110\rangle\) on the last three modes.'

  #transversal_gates: 'Transversal ... gates \cite{doi:ok-paper}. Comment out if doesn''t apply.'

  general_gates:
    - 'Single qubit gates implemented using linear optical networks, sometimes with the addition of auxiliary modes with vacuum input and (conditional) output.'

  decoders:
    - 'Destructive measurement with photon number measurements on each mode.'
    - 'MWPM decoding algorithm \cite{doi:good-paper} with ... overhead.'

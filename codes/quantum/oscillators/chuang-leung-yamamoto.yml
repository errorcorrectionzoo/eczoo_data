# code id, physical, logical are all lower case
code_id: chuang-leung-yamamoto
physical: oscillators
logical: qubits

name: 'Chuang-Leung-Yamamoto'

# First reference with the code (optional).
introduced: '\cite{doi:10.1103/PhysRevA.56.1114}'

# Anything applicable to a larger parent set of codes (see below) should go in
# that entry instead of here.
description: 'Codes parametrized by \([[N,M,2^k,d]]\). Encodes \(k\) qubits with distance \(d\) in \(m\) bosonic modes using states with total excitation number \(N\). A given Fock state will appear in at most one codeword.'

protection: 'Protects against amplitude damping for loss of up to \(t = d-1\) excitations.'

# This field starts a list of specific labeled subfields; do not leave it
# empty. If empty, comment out. Also, indentations are important!
features:

  # Any fields below should be omitted if they do not apply.

  rate: '\(r=\frac{k}{m \log_2(N+1)}\), with \(m\) the number of modes, and \(N\) the maximum allowed excitation number. To correct the loss of up to \(t\) excitations with \(l_0+1\) codewords, a code exists with scaling \(N \sim t^3l_0/2\).'

  # This field that starts a list of strings, indexed by a dash; do not leave it
  # empty. If empty, comment out.
  encoders: 
    - 'Photon Fock state input into a network of beamsplitters, phase shifters, and Kerr media. State preparation may require ancillary modes and be conditioned on photon number measurement result.'

  #transversal_gates: 'Transversal ... gates \cite{doi:ok-paper}. Comment out if doesn''t apply.'

  decoders:
    - 'Destructive decoding with a photon number measurement on each mode.'
    - 'State can be decoded with a network of beamsplitters, phase shifters, and Kerr media.'

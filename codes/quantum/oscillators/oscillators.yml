description: |
  Also called an \textit{oscillator} or a \textit{continuous-variable (CV)} code.
  Encodes logical Hilbert space, finite- or infinite-dimensional, into a physical Hilbert space that contains at least one \textit{oscillator} (a.k.a. \textit{bosonic mode} or \textit{qumode}).
  States of a single oscillator are elements of the Hilbert space of \(\ell^2\)-normalizable functions on \(\mathbb{R}\).
  Ideal codewords may not be normalizable because the space is infinite-dimensional, so approximate versions have to be constructed in practice.'

  An error set relevant to \hyperref[code:oscillator_stabilizer]{bosonic stabilizer} codes is the set of \textit{displacement operators}, a bosonic analogue of the Pauli string basis for \hyperref[code:qubits_into_qubits]{qubit} codes. For a single mode, its elements are products of exponentials of the mode's position and momentum operators, acting on the mode's position states \(|y\rangle\) for \(y\in\mathbb{R}\) as
  \begin{align}
    e^{-iq\hat{p}}\left|y\right\rangle =\left|y+q\right\rangle \,\,\text{ and }\,\,e^{iq\hat{x}}\left|y\right\rangle =e^{iq y}\left|y\right\rangle ~,
  \end{align}
  where \(q\in\mathbb{R}\).
  For multiple modes, error set elements are tensor products of elements of the single-oscillator error set, characterized by the vector of coefficients \(\xi\in\mathbb{R}^{2n}\).

  The displacement error set is a unitary basis for trace-class linear operators on the \(n\)-mode Hilbert space that is Dirac-orthonormal under the Hilbert-Schmidt inner product \cite{doi:10.1103/PhysRev.177.1857}.
  There are two definitions of code distance associated with displacements.
  The definition inherited from qubit codes is the minimum weight of a displacement operator (i.e., number of nonzero entries in \(\xi\)) that implements a nontrivial logical operation in the code. The second definition is the minimum Euclidean distance (i.e., \(\ell^2\)-norm of \(\xi\)) such that the corresponding displacement implements a nontrivial logical operation in the code.

  An error set relevant to \hyperref[code:fock_state]{Fock-state bosonic} codes is the set of loss operators associated with the \textit{amplitude damping} (a.k.a. \textit{photon loss} or \textit{attenuation}) noise channel, a common form of physical noise in bosonic systems. For a single mode, loss operators are proportional to powers of the mode's annihilation operator \(a=(\hat{x}+i\hat{p})/\sqrt{2}\), where \(\hat x\) (\(\hat p\)) is the mode's position (momentum) operator, and with the power signifying the number of particles lost during the error. For multiple modes, error set elements are tensor products of elements of the single-mode error set. A definition of distance associated with this error set is the minimum weight of a loss error that implements a nontrivial logical operation in the code.

  An related error set is the set of powers of the \textit{Susskindâ€“Glogower phase operator} \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{a a^\dagger}} a\) and its adjoint \cite{doi:10.1103/PhysicsPhysiqueFizika.1.49,doi:10.1016/0003-4916(91)90037-9,arxiv:quant-ph/0109066} along with Fock-space rotations generated by the occupation number operator \(a^\dagger a\).
  These can also be obtained from qudit Pauli matrices through a limiting procedure \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/0109066} and allow one to expand trace-class operators despite not forming an orthonormal set \cite{arxiv:2211.05714}. These operators are correspong to the \textit{number-phase interpretation}, a polar-like decomposition of a single mode, complementing the cartesian-like decomposition in terms of position and momentum displacements.

features:
  rate: 'The quantum capacity of the pure-loss channel \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/0606132} and the dephasing noise channel \cite{arxiv:2205.05736} are both known.
  The capacity of the displacement noise channel, the quantum analogue of AGWN, has been bounded using GKP codes \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/0105058,arxiv:1801.07271}.'

  general_gates:
    - 'Analogues of qubit Pauli operations are the displacement operations, which are unitaries generated by linear combinations of positions and momenta. Analogues of Clifford-group transformations are the Gaussian unitary transformations \cite{arxiv:1110.3234}, which are unitaries generated by quadratic polynomials in positions and momenta.'
    - 'A cubic phase gate is required to make a universal gate set on the oscillator \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/0410100}.
    More generally, controllability has only been proven when the normalizable state space is restricted to Shwartz space, the space of states with bounded moments of position and momentum \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/0505063}.'
    - 'The number-phase interpretation allows for the mapping of rotor Clifford gates into the oscillator, some of which become non-unitary (e.g., conditional occupation number addition) \cite{arxiv:2311.07679}.'

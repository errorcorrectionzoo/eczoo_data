name: 'Fusion Based Quantum Computing'

introduced: '\cite{arXiv:2101.09310}'

description: 'Fusion Based Quantum Computing, or FBQC, describes a fault tolerant way to produce
Fusion Networks, or large entangled states starting from small constant-sized entangled resource states
along with destructive measurements called Fusions. These large states can be produced asychronously in the fusion framework.
These large entangled states can then be used as resources (cluster states for computation) or as logical states of topological codes.'

protection: 'Protects against erasure, Pauli errors, photon loss, fusion failure (from non-determinism), and faulty resource states'

features:

  encoders:
    - 'Resource state generators, which produce small constant size cluster states'
    - 'Fusion measurements (Bell fusions)'

  general_gates:
    - 'Clifford gates by creating topological features such as boundaries, defects, or twists, which can be done by single qubit measurements.'
    - 'Logical gates can be performed by code deformation'
    - 'Non Clifford gates by Magic-state injection'
    - 'Logical Clifford operations can be kept track of using the classical Pauli frame register and need not be explicitly applied at the quantum level.'


  decoders:
    - 'Logical timescales are separated from the physical measurement timescales'
    - 'Decoding syndrome information is tracked in the Pauli frame'

  fault_tolerance:
    - 'Fusion networks are constructed in a fault tolerant way'
    - 'Redundancy in fusion outcomes is captured by the check operator group'
    - 'Fusion measurement outcomes form a syndrom that allows to correct for Pauli errors'
    - 'There is no physical error correction, and decoding output is simply used to update the Pauli frame'
    - 'Fusion networks can be created in a way that naturally encodes topological fault tolerance (surface code).'

  threshold:
    - '11.98\% against erasure in fusion measurements'
    - '1.07\% against Pauli error'
    - 'In linear optical systems, can tolerate 10.4\% probability of photon loss in each fusion'
    - '43.2\% against fusion failure'

realizations:

  - 'Can be realized in Linear Optical systems.'

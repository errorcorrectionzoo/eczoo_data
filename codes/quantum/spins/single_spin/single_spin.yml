code_id: single_spin
physical: spins

name: 'Single-spin code'

description: |
  An encoding into a monolithic (i.e. non-tensor-product) Hilbert space that houses an irreducible representation of \(SU(2)\) or, more generally, another Lie group.
  In some cases, this space can be thought of as the permutation invariant subspace of a particular tensor-product space.

  For the simplest case of \(SU(2)\), a single-spin code can be thought of as a permutation invariant qubit code encoding a \(K\)-dimensional Hilbert space into the maximally symmetric subspace or \textit{collective spin} of \(2\ell\) spin-half systems.
  This \(2\ell+1\)-dimensional Hilbert space can be thought of as a standalone spin-\(\ell\) quantum system.

protection: |
  Noise models can be categorized as those that cause the state to leave the maximally symmetric subspace and those that do not. The former include single-spin errors akin to qubit Pauli noise. The latter include collective rotations or decays.
  A particular error basis of interest consists of the spherical tensors \cite{arxiv:2304.08611}.

features:
  transversal_gates: 'When the physical Hilbert space is thought of a collective spin, logical gates for spin codes have the form \(U^{\otimes N}\), where \(U\) is a local rotation on the physical system.'

      detail: 'Single-spin codes are subspaces of a single large spin, which can be either standalone or correspond to the permutation-invariant subspace of a set of spins.
      A single-spin code correcting spherical tensors can be mapped into a permutation-invariant code with an analogous distance \cite[Thm. 1]{arxiv:2310.17652}.'

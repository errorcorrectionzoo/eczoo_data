code_id: single_spin
physical: spins

name: 'Single-spin code'

description: |
  An encoding into a monolithic (i.e. non-tensor-product) Hilbert space that houses an irreducible representation of \(SU(2)\) or, more generally, another Lie group.
  In some cases, this space can be thought of as the permutation invariant subspace of a particular tensor-product space.

  The analogue of oscillator coherent states for single spins are the spin coherent states \cite{doi:10.1088/0305-4470/4/3/009}. 

protection: |
  Noise models can be categorized as those that cause the state to leave the maximally symmetric subspace and those that do not.

  Noise models that do not preserve the PI subspace correspond to models for the tensor-product case.
  Single spin-half errors do not preserve permutation symmetry and correspond to qubit Pauli noise.

  Noise models that preserve the PI subspace are typically relevant to the case of a monolithic spin.
  They include collective rotations or decays.
  A continuous-time single-spin noise channel akin to the depolarizing channel is the Landau-Streater channel \cite{doi:10.1016/0024-3795(93)90274-R}.
  A particular error basis of interest consists of the spherical tensors \cite{arxiv:2304.08611}.

rate: 'There exists a family of single-spin codes for \(SU(q=N)\) with logical dimension \(K = o(2^N)\) and distance of \hyperref[topic:asymptotics]{order} \(o(N/\log N)\) \cite{arxiv:2509.20545}.'

features:
  transversal_gates:
    - 'When the physical Hilbert space is thought of a collective spin, logical gates for spin codes have the form \(U^{\otimes N}\), where \(U\) is a local rotation on the physical system.'

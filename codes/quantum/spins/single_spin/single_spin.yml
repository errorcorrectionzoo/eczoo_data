code_id: single_spin
physical: spins

name: 'Single-spin code'
introduced: '\cite{arxiv:1205.4517}'

description: |
  An encoding into a monolithic (i.e. non-tensor-product) Hilbert space that houses an irreducible representation of \(SU(2)\) or, more generally, another Lie group.
  In some cases, this space can be thought of as the permutation invariant subspace of a particular tensor-product space.

  The analogue of oscillator coherent states for single spins are the spin coherent states \cite{doi:10.1088/0305-4470/4/3/009}. 

protection: |
  For the \(SU(2)\) case, a continuous-time single-spin noise channel akin to the depolarizing channel is the Landau-Streater channel \cite{doi:10.1016/0024-3795(93)90274-R}.
  A particular error basis of interest consists of the spherical tensors \cite{arxiv:2304.08611}.

  The \(SU(2)\) Lie Algebra can also be used as a noise model; it connects states whose angular momentum projections differ by at most an integer \cite{arxiv:2005.10910}.
  More generally, the group's Lie algebra induces a metric on the carrying vector space, and its operators can be chosen as a noise basis \cite{arxiv:1205.4517}. Code existence is guaranteed by the Tverberg theorem \cite{arxiv:1205.4517}.
  There are \hyperref[topic:quantum-weight-enumerator]{quantum MacWilliams identities} for such metric spaces \cite{arxiv:1205.4517}.


features:
  rate: 'There exists a family of single-spin codes for \(SU(q=N)\) with logical dimension \(K = o(2^N)\) and distance of \hyperref[topic:asymptotics]{order} \(o(N/\log N)\) \cite{arxiv:2509.20545}.'

description: |
  A quantum code which encodes quantum information in a tensor factor of a subspace that is decomposed into a tensor product of subsystems.

  A subsystem code encodes information in a subsystem \(\mathsf{A}\) of the code space \(\mathsf{C}\), which is part of the system Hilbert space \(\mathsf{H}\), as
  \begin{align}
  \mathsf{H}=\mathsf{C} \oplus \mathsf{C}^{\perp} = \mathsf{A} \otimes \mathsf{B} \oplus \mathsf{C}^{\perp}~.
  \end{align}
  Following an error, it is sufficient to revert back to the original state modulo a transformation on the auxiliary or \textit{gauge} subsystem \(\mathsf{B}\). The subsystem \(\mathsf{B}\) therefore gives additional freedom to the error correction process, and is said to encode \textit{gauge qubits} when its dimension is a power of two. While strictly speaking all operator QECCs are also ordinary QECCs, the attachment of a subsystem to a code allows for a wider variety of encoding procedures, fault-tolerant logical operations, and efficient error-correction protocols.

protection: |
  Necessary and sufficient \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/0506069} error-correction conditions are, for all errors \(E_a,E_b\) in an error set \(\cal{E}\),
  \begin{align}
  \Pi E^{\dagger}_a E_b \Pi = I_{\mathsf{A}} \otimes g_{ab}^{\mathsf{B}}
  \end{align}
  where \(\Pi\) is a projector onto the codespace \(\mathsf{C}\), and \(g_{ab}^{\mathsf{B}}\) is an arbitrary operator on the gauge subsystem.
  These have been studied in the presence of continuous noise \cite{arxiv:0806.3145}.

  A \textit{unitarily correctable subsystem} is a subsystem code whose encoded information can be recovered via a unitary, i.e., in a measurement-free way \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/0608045} (see also \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/9609015}). For unital noise channels, such codes are related to the multiplicative domain of the channel \cite{arxiv:0811.0947}.

  encoders:
    - 'Subsystem QECCs are robust to initialization errors \cite{arxiv:0709.3533}.'
  decoders:
    - 'Petz recovery map is shown to be near-optimal for certain subsystem codes \cite{arxiv:1202.5139}.'

realizations:
  - 'A two-qubit unitarily correctable subsystem code recovery has been realized in an optical system \cite{arxiv:0909.1584}.'

notes:
  - 'See Refs. \cite{arxiv:math/0404553,arxiv:math/0506491,doi:10.1017/CBO9781139034807.008} for an introduction to operator QEC.'

# 20240704 subsystem QECC, hybrid QECC, and QECC are three children of OAQECC

    - code_id: oaecc
      detail: 'An OAQECC which has gauge structure (e.g., gauge qubits) but no block structure is a subsystem QECC.'
  cousins:
    - code_id: qecc
      detail: 'A subsystem QECC reduces to an ordinary (i.e., subspace) QECC when the gauge subsystem is trivial.
      Conversely, any QECC with a tensor-product logical subspace can be turned into a subsystem code by treating a logical tensor factor as a gauge subsystem.'

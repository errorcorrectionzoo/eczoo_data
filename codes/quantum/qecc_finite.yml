name: 'Finite-dimensional quantum code'

# Following Gottesman's book
description: 'A quantum error-correcting code that encodes quantum information in a \(K\)-dimensional (\textit{logical}) subspace \(\mathsf{H}_K\) of an \(N\)-dimensional (\textit{physical}) Hilbert space \(\mathsf{H}_N\) such that it is possible to recover said information from errors.'

protection: |
  Formally, a finite-dimensional quantum code \((U,\cal{E})\) is a partial isometry \(U:\mathsf{H}_{K}\to\mathsf{H}_{N}\) with a set of correctable errors \({\cal{E}}:\mathsf{H}_N\to\mathsf{H}_M\) with the following property: there exists a quantum operation \({\cal{D}}:\mathsf{H}_M\to \mathsf{H}_K\) such that for all \(E\in\cal{E}\) and states \(|\psi\rangle\in\mathsf{H}_{K}\),
  \begin{align}
  {\cal D}(EU|\psi\rangle\langle\psi|U^{\dagger}E^{\dagger})=c(E,|\psi\rangle)|\psi\rangle\langle\psi|\end{align}
  for some constant \(c\).

  Equivalently, correction capability is determined by the Knill-Laflamme error correction criteria \cite{arXiv:quant-ph/9604034,arXiv:quant-ph/9604024}. A code that satisfies these conditions approximately, i.e., up to some small quantifiable error, is called an \hyperref[code:approximate_qecc]{approximate code}.

# Include complementary channel + approximate defs; approx should be a separate property or not?

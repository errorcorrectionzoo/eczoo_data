name: 'Finite-dimensional quantum error-correcting code'
short_name: 'Finite QECC'

# Following Gottesman's book
description: 'Encodes quantum information in a \(K\)-dimensional (\textit{logical}) subspace of an \(N\)-dimensional (\textit{physical}) Hilbert space such that it is possible to recover said information from errors. The logical subspace is spanned by a basis comprised of \textit{code basis states} or \textit{codewords}.'

  Denoting Hilbert spaces by the letter \(\mathsf{H}\), a finite-dimensional quantum code \((U,\cal{E})\) is a partial isometry \(U:\mathsf{H}_{K}\to\mathsf{H}_{N}\) with a set of correctable errors \({\cal{E}}:\mathsf{H}_N\to\mathsf{H}_M\) with the following property: there exists a quantum operation \({\cal{D}}:\mathsf{H}_M\to \mathsf{H}_K\) such that for all \(E\in\cal{E}\) and states \(|\psi\rangle\in\mathsf{H}_{K}\),
  \begin{align}
  {\cal D}(EU|\psi\rangle\langle\psi|U^{\dagger}E^{\dagger})=c(E,|\psi\rangle)|\psi\rangle\langle\psi|\end{align}
  for some constant \(c\) \cite{preset:GottesmanBook}. A code is said to \textit{protect against} or \textit{correct} the errors \(\mathcal{E}\).

  \begin{defterm}{Knill-Laflamme conditions}
  Equivalently, correction capability is determined by of the \textit{quantum
  error-correction conditions}
  \cite{arXiv:quant-ph/9604034,arXiv:quant-ph/9604024}, which may admit infinite
  terms due to non-normalizability of ideal code states. A code that satisfies
  these conditions approximately, i.e., up to some small quantifiable error, is
  called an \hyperref[code:approximate_qecc]{approximate code}.

    \paragraph{Knill-Laflamme error correction conditions}
    In a finite-dimensional Hilbert space, there are necessary and sufficient
    conditions for a code to successfully
    correct a set of errors.  These are called the \emph{Knill-Laflamme
    conditions}~\cite{arXiv:quant-ph/9604034,preset:PreskillNotes,doi:10.1017/CBO9780511976667}.
    Using the notation above, a code \(U\) with code space projector \(\Pi = U U^\dagger\)
    can correct a set of errors \(\{ E_j \}\) if and only if
    \begin{align}
      \Pi E_i E_j^\dagger \Pi = c_{ij}\, \Pi\qquad\text{for all \(i,j\),}
    \end{align}
    where \(c_{ij}\) can be arbitrary numbers.
  \end{defterm}

  A code is \textit{degenerate} with respect to a noise model if different errors map code states to the same error subspace. For a linearly independent error set \(\cal{E}\), degeneracy is equivalent to \(\text{rank}(C_{ab}) < |\cal{E}|\).

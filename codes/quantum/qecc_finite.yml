name: 'Finite-dimensional quantum error-correcting code'
short_name: 'Finite QECC'

# Following Gottesman's book
description: 'Encodes quantum information in a \(K\)-dimensional (\textit{logical}) subspace of an \(N\)-dimensional (\textit{physical}) Hilbert space such that it is possible to recover said information from errors. The logical subspace is spanned by a basis comprised of \textit{code basis states} or \textit{codewords}.'

  Denoting Hilbert spaces by the letter \(\mathsf{H}\), a finite-dimensional quantum code \((U,\cal{E})\) is a partial isometry \(U:\mathsf{H}_{K}\to\mathsf{H}_{N}\) with a set of correctable errors \({\cal{E}}:\mathsf{H}_N\to\mathsf{H}_M\) with the following property: there exists a quantum operation \({\cal{D}}:\mathsf{H}_M\to \mathsf{H}_K\) such that for all \(E\in\cal{E}\) and states \(|\psi\rangle\in\mathsf{H}_{K}\),
  \begin{align}
  {\cal D}(EU|\psi\rangle\langle\psi|U^{\dagger}E^{\dagger})=c(E,|\psi\rangle)|\psi\rangle\langle\psi|\end{align}
  for some constant \(c\). A code is said to \textit{protect against} or \textit{correct} the errors \(\mathcal{E}\).

  Equivalently, correction capability is determined by the \textit{quantum error-correction conditions} \cite{arXiv:quant-ph/9604034,arXiv:quant-ph/9604024}: for all \(|\psi\rangle,|\phi\rangle\in\mathsf{H}_{N}\) and all errors \(E_a,E_b\in{\mathcal{E}}\),
  \begin{align}
    \langle \psi | E^{\dagger}_a E_b |\phi \rangle = C_{ab} \langle \psi | \phi \rangle~,
  \end{align}
  where the coefficients \(C_{ab}\) do not depend on \(|\psi\rangle\) or \(|\phi\rangle\). A code that satisfies these conditions approximately, i.e., up to some small quantifiable error, is called an \hyperref[code:approximate_qecc]{approximate error-correcting code}.

  A code is \textit{degenerate} with respect to a noise model if different errors map code states to the same error subspace. For a linearly independent error set \(\cal{E}\), degeneracy is equivalent to \(\text{rank}(C_{ab}) < |\cal{E}|\).

# Include complementary channel + approximate defs; approx should be a separate property or not?

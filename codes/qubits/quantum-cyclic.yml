description: 'Every linear stabilizer code \(C\) has an associated totally isotropic subspace \(S\subset F_2^{2n}\). Quantum cyclic codes are those codes where \(S\) and its centralizer are ideals in the polynomial ring \(F_4[X]/X^n-1\).'

features:

  # The fields below relate to specific properties of the code that are worth
  # noting. In some cases (see below), there might be multiple pieces of
  # information associated with a field (e.g., mutliple encoders/decoders,
  # multiple facts about fault tolerance, etc.); in such cases, the field
  # accepts a list of text entries, with one item per piece of information.
  #
  # Any fields below should be omitted if they do not apply.

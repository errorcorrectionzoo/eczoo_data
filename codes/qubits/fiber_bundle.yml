description: 'Broadly speaking, fiber bundle codes are constructed by taking the twisted product of two classical codes. Here the product refers to the tensor product of two chain complexes, which here represent classical codes. Combining classical codes through a tensor product of chain complexes is itself a powerful technique because it produces quantum codes that inherit the distances of the classical codes with only a quadratic blow-up in the number of qubits \cite{arxiv:0903.0566}. In the case of fiber bundle codes, the distance can be further improved by introducing twists. In a twisted product, one of the codes is called the base and remains fixed while the other, called the fiber, undergoes various automorphisms. More specifically, the boundary map for the resulting chain complex applies an automorphism to the fiber whenever base cells are mapped to their boundary cell. These twists can improve the x distance of the quantum code. Through subsequent distance balancing \cite{arxiv:1611.03790}, which increases the z distance to be equal to the x distance, this can produce quantum LDPC codes that break the $\text{polylog}(n)\sqrt{n}$ distance barrier. In Hastings, Haah, and O'donnell's construction, they used this twisted product method to combine a random LDPC code as the base and a cyclic repetition code as the fiber. After applying distance balancing, they obtained a quantum LDPC code with distance $\Omega(n^{3/5}\text{polylog}(n))$ and rate $\Omega(n^{-2/5}\text{polylog}(n))$ where n is the number of physical qubits. In addition, this is an LDPC code in the sense that each stabilizer generator has weight at most ${polylog}(n)$ and each qubit participates in at most ${polylog}(n)$ stabilizer generators.'

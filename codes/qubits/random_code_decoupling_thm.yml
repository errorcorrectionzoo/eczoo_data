description: 'Hayden et al. \cite{arXiv:0702005} showed that the quantum channel capacity can be achieved by encoding in a random codespace that is chosen via Haar random unitaries. In particular, they show that such codes achieve perfect transmission by proving that the encoded information is decoupled from the environment. This is a necessary and sufficient condition for successful decoding since measurements of the environment should never reveal the encoded information \cite{doi:10.1103/PhysRevA.54.2629}. Intuitively, coupling with the environment can be decreased by projecting the system onto a random codespace. The more qubits that are randomly discarded, the more the codespace is decoupled from the environment. One may ask what is the least amount of qubits that can be discarded, i.e. the largest remaining codespace, that still achieves decoupling. It can be shown through the decoupling inequality \cite{arXiv:quant-ph/0512247} that the largest possible dimension of the random codespace that achieves decoupling is exactly the coherent information of the channel. Therefore, there exists codes that can transmit information with rate equal to the coherent information. Furthermore, these codes can be constructed with high probability by randomly projecting from an n-dimensional space where n is the number of physical qubits to a k-dimensional codespace where k/n is equal to the coherent information.'

notes:
  - 'This construction uses Haar random unitaries to choose the codespace, but it is possible to approximate this using Clifford gates. Since Clifford gates form unitary 2-designs, this protocol shows that random stabilizer codes also achieve the coherent information.'

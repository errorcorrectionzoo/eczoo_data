code_id: classical_into_quantum

name: 'Classical-quantum (c-q) code'

description: |
  Code designed specifically for transmission of classical information through non-classical channels, e.g., quantum channels, hybrid quantum-classical channels, or channels with classical inputs and quantum outputs. 
  Such codes include maps from a classical alphabet into a quantum Hilbert space.

  rate: |
    The Holevo channel capacity,
    \begin{align}
      C=\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{1}{n}\chi\left({\cal N}^{\otimes n}\right)~,
    \end{align}
    where \(\chi\) is the Holevo information,
    is the highest rate of classical information transmission through a quantum channel with arbitrarily small error rate \cite{manual:{A. S. Holevo, “Bounds for the Quantity of Information Transmitted by a Quantum Communication Channel”, Probl. Peredachi Inf., 9:3 (1973), 3–11; Problems Inform. Transmission, 9:3 (1973), 177–183},doi:10.1103/PhysRevA.56.131,doi:10.1109/18.651037}.

    This capacity is equal to the \textit{single-letter} Holevo information of a single copy of the channel, \(\chi(\cal{N})\), for all known deterministically constructed channels.
    However, it is known to be superadditive, i.e., not equal to the single-copy case, for particular random channels \cite{arxiv:0809.3972}.

    Corrections to the Holevo capacity and tradeoff between decoding error, code rate and code length are determined in quantum generalizations of small \cite{arxiv:1308.6503}, moderate \cite{arxiv:1701.03114,arxiv:1709.05258}, and large \cite{arxiv:1409.3562} deviation analysis.
    Bounds exist on the one-shot capacity, i.e., the achievability of classical codes given only one use of the quantum channel.
    The ideal decoding error is suppressed exponentially with the number of subsystems \(n\) (for c-q block codes), and the achievable exponent has been studied in Refs. \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/9703013,arxiv:quant-ph/9907087,arxiv:quant-ph/0206186,arxiv:quant-ph/0611013,arxiv:0805.4092,arxiv:1007.5456,arxiv:1312.3822,arxiv:2208.02132,arxiv:2310.09014}; see \cite[Table 2]{arxiv:2208.02132} for a summary.
    Achievable error exponents for communication are related to those for privacy amplification \cite{arxiv:2207.08899}.
    In the high-rate case, a lower \cite{arxiv:1201.5411} and upper \cite{arxiv:2407.12403} bound on the error exponent for general channels matches a conjecture by Holevo \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/9907087}.

    Unambiguous state discrimination (USD) can be used to achieve Holevo capacity on a general pure-state c-q channel \cite{doi:10.1109/ISIT.2013.6620209}.

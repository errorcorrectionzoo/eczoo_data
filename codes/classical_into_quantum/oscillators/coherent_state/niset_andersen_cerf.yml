code_id: niset_andersen_cerf
physical: oscillators
logical: reals

name: 'Niset-Andersen-Cerf code'
introduced: '\cite{arXiv:0710.4858}'

description: 'Coherent-state c-q code encoding two-mode coherent states \(\{|\alpha\rangle, |\beta\rangle\}\) into four modes such that the complex values \((\alpha,\beta)\) are recoverable after a single-mode erasure. There are two variations of the storage procedure: a deterministic protocol that offers recovery against a single mode erasure, and a probabalistic that can protect against multiple errors with post selection. This code is effectively protecting classical information stored in \((\alpha,\beta)\) using quantum operations.'

protection: 'The deterministic protocol protects against a single erasure error on a known mode. This recovers one state perfectly and the other state with fidelity \(F = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-2 r}}\) for an initial EPR pair squeezed with variance \(e^{-2r}\). The probabalistic protocol utilizes post-selection to protect against multiple erasures with state-dependent fidelity.'

features:

  encoders:
    - 'After an EPR pair preparation, use 2 continuous CNOT and 2 continuous inverse CNOT gates to entangle a bosonic EPR pair with initial states \(|\alpha \rangle\) and \(|\beta \rangle\).'
    - 'Alternate optical encoder using a two-mode squeezed vacuum state and two balanced beam splitters to mix the input coherent states with the EPR pair.'

  decoders:
    - 'Optical decoder using three beam splitters, electronic gain detectors, and two phase-insensitive amplifiers as described in Ref. \cite{arXiv:0710.4858}.'

realizations:
  - 'Realized in Ref. \cite{arxiv:1006.3941} in an optical system with 3 beam-splitters. The fidelity peaked around \(0.6\) for deterministic approach, and around \(0.77\) for the probabilistic approach (with a 25\% chance of error).'

      detail: 'The Niset-Andersen-Cerf code encodes two coherent states at a time with arbitrary complex values, making it analogous to a two-point QAM code. The code does not encode any quantum information since superpositions of the coherent states are not stored. However, analysis of the code is done via a quantum treatment.'

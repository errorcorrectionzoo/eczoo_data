name: 'Molecular codes'

description: 'Encodes finite-dimensional Hilbert space into the Hilbert space of \(\ell^2\)-normalizable functions on the group \(SO_3\). Construction is based on nested subgroups \(H\subset K \subset SO_3\), where \(H,K\) are finite. The \(|K|/|H|\)-dimensional logical subspace is spanned by basis states that are equal superpositions of elements of cosets of \(H\) in \(K\).'

protection: 'Protects against generalized bit-flip errors \(g\in SO_3\) that are inside the fundamental domain of \(G/K\). Protection against phase-flip errors determined by branching rules of irreps of \(G\) into those of \(K\), and further into those of \(H\).'

notes: 'Physical space characterizes orientations of a rigid body in 3D, which correspond to rotational states of an asymmetric molecule.'

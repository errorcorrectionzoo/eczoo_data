name: 'Zetterberg code'
introduced: '\cite{doi:10.1109/TIT.1962.1057682}'


description: 'The Zetterberg code \(C_s\) is a binary cyclic code of length \(n = 2^{2s}+1\) generated by the
minimal polynomial \(g_s(x)\) of \(\alpha\) over GF(2), where \(\alpha\) is a primitive \(n^{th}\) root of unity in the field GF\((2^{4s})\).'

protection: 'Correct all weight-2 errors with a small number of exceptions. By making some alterations to the code, one can form codes that correct all weight-2 errors.'


features:


  rate: 'The rate is given by \(1-\frac{4s}{n}\), which is asymptotically good, but the minimum distance is a constant of either 5 or 6.'

  encoders:
    - 'Systematic or non-systematic encoding of information word like in all cyclic codes.'

  decoders:
    - 'Decoding through linear-feedback shift registers.'
    - 'Kallquist first described an algebraic decoding theorem. A faster version was later provided in \cite{doi:10.1109/18.149509} and further modified in \cite{doi:10.1109/LCOMM.2010.07.100784} which can detect up to weight error of 3.'

realizations:
  - 'Code used to provide better protection of data transmission with its double error correcting capacity.'

notes:
  - 'Quasi-perfect, i.e. each n-dimensional binary vector is at most at distance 3 from a codeword.'
  - 'One of the best known families of double-error correcting binary linear codes.'

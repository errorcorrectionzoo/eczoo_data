      \text{It has been only in the past two or three years that the theory of error-correcting codes has advanced sufficiently to provide the basis for practical systems. Computer technology also has continued to advance, decreasing the cost and increasing the speed of equipment used to implement error correction. At the same time, there is a growing need for communication channels of extreme reliability for computers and automatic control systems. As the need grows and as coding theory and computer technology continue to develop, error detection and error correction will play an essential role in the success of complex systems.}

      \text{Many of us are hopeful that quantum computers will become practical and useful computing devices some time during the 21st century. It is probably fair to say, though, that none of us can now envision exactly what the hardware of that machine of the future will be like; surely, it will be much different than the sort of hardware that experimental physicists are  investigating these days. But of one thing we can be quite confident—that a practical quantum computer will incorporate some type of error correction into its operation. Quantum computers are far more susceptible to making errors than conventional digital computers, and some method of controlling and correcting those errors will be needed to prevent a quantum computer from crashing.}

      \text{The ultimate detectability of optical signals and the accuracy with which their parameters can be estimated cannot be ascertained by the methods of detection theory that apply at radio frequencies; the fundamental concepts of the theory must be revised.}

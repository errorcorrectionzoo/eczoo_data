#
# Manually specify DOIs for specific arXiv identifiers.
#
# This manual override should only be used in exceptional cases where the
# arXiv entry does not list the DOI or if the listed DOI is incomplete or
# incorrect.  E.g. https://github.com/errorcorrectionzoo/eczoo_data/issues/43
#
# Note: quote keys so that they don't get parsed as floating point numbers (!!)
#

'1604.04062': '10.26421/QIC16.15-16-1'
'1411.3334': '10.1109/TIT.2017.2663199'

# In this case, the DOI listed on Quantum's own webpage
# (https://quantum-journal.org/papers/q-2021-12-20-605/) does not work!  So
# let's pretend that there is no associated DOI so that, at least, we get an
# arXiv citation.
#  '2108.10457': null
